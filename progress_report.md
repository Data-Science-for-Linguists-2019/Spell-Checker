# Progress Report

## Preliminary Report (2/7/19)
I created a GitHub repository, wrote a README document, and pushed the project plan. After the project ideas' feedback, I decided to focus on spell checker more. Then I can use this model to detect L2 learners' spelling mistakes. I need to search more articles about spell checker now; after that, I can go deeply into these field. For the data part, I choose twenty popular books from [Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) now. I hope to examine this small portion data first to help me understand the basic knowledge behind spell checker.

## First Progress Report (2/21/19)
In this part, I have completed the data acquisition process, and choose the 20 txt files from [Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) as my model training data. Here is my [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Spell-Checker/blob/master/spell_checker_main.ipynb). For the project goal, I want to increase the performance of the spell checker model that I reference from this [Github project](https://github.com/Currie32/Spell-Checker). I attempt to build a model and know the knowledge behind it. Here I encounter some problem is that I do not have computing resource, so I try to use Pitt CRC(center for research and computing) resource as my training machine. However, there are several environment issue need to be resolved.

#### Sharing plan
I think it is fine to share the data from The Project Gutenberg website because their copyrights have expired. I plan to share the sample one. If it is needed, I can share more data to help me explain my result.
