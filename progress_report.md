# Progress Report

## Preliminary Report (2/7/19)
I created a GitHub repository, wrote a README document, and pushed the project plan. After the project ideas' feedback, I decided to focus on spell checker more. Then I can use this model to detect L2 learners' spelling mistakes. I need to search more articles about spell checker now; after that, I can go deeply into these field. For the data part, I choose twenty popular books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) now. I hope to examine this small portion data first to help me understand the basic knowledge behind spell checker.
