Causes of Happiness

Happiness is what actually makes us alive. Almost all inventions and creations were made because of people who experienced happiness. If we look around, we'll see amazing things like buildings, subways, and airplanes and we'll know what these people have made. There is a relationship between the causes of happiness and what people believe.

Actions and acts of others have affected our happiness. Because of family, neighbors, and even coworkers' affecting our emotions, our happiness is affected by their actions. The smallest act or even a word from others can change our minds and thoughts. Actions of people around us decided our path. We'll make a positive action because of receiving a positive affect. But if we get a negative affect, we'll make horrible decisions. Big companies always have good relationships between managers and workers and that only happened because of good acts between them.

People can be the reason of their own happiness. Sometimes our own actions give us different emotions. Every single act that we do or even the things that we say affect our feelings. If we said or act badly, we'll feel guilty and act wrong. Many people are dealing with their bad decisions by committing suicide. Others with good decisions are successful in life.

Many people believe that destiny or fate is the major reason of happiness. Things that happened to us or that we do and did are all destined to be. Some people sometimes experience different emotions in different times without a reason. They believe that it's destined for them to have these feelings so their next action will be decided according to these emotions. Wearing some cloths or seeing a kind of birds may be a good luck for someone. Some other things may bring misfortune like untied shoe. I believe that people are responsible for their own actions and happiness. Only our own actions and others' affect our happiness.

Because of happiness being the target of all humans, it's not easy to gain. All of us are trying to find better ways to reach happiness. In order for us to be better and to be happier we have to find the things that most make us reach happiness.

Nowdays, the world has a big problem that affects all humans without distinction: Pollution. In the human history people have maltreated the planet. Many years ago damages could de fixed by own nature, but now population is bigger and the effect of pollution has become more dangerous. There are three crucial points to talk about pollution: natural effects, economical effects, and social and political effects.

It is obvious that pollution has an important effect on nature. The cities and factories are huge and they produce tons and tons of residues and garbage. Those residues are difficult to eliminate and make the land and water to be contaminated. That reduce the value and the right uses of ground and cultivations, and it is also a real problem in drinking water. In addition, factories, machines and cars all over the world generate too much CO2. This causes air pollution and global warming.

It is a truth that occidental countries see pollution like a threat. Because of that the society is being persuaded and habits are changing. But it is not enough. Big improvements and political decisions must be done to solve the problem. It means new sources of energy instead of petroleum, and global and organized ways of act. It is a fact that cities and population are bigger each day. In this sense, it seems absolutely necessary to recycle all kinds of residues in big amounts, and to involve citizens and companies of every country.

But if we think in the improvements mentioned before, another effect appears: Economy. All this means money. On one hand, the world is guided by the rules of economical interests of a few powerful men. On the other hand, improvements and develop involve huge inversions with results only in a long term. So the question is not as simple as it could seems.

In conclusion, pollution is a real problem nowdays and its effects involve many areas. The planet need improvements, but it will not be easy because of economical interest. In any case humanity must do something to avoid worse consequences, if we think about the future.

32198,bq8,4350,"Choosing Between a Rented Housing and a Homestay

        When ELI students come to the United States, they are first worried whether rented housing or a homestay is better. Most of them simply think rented housing is better because living alone is more comfortable. However, this choice is not simple and they should consider many things related to American life. Sometimes, living alone is inconvenient and a homestay can eliminate loneliness.
        Compared to a rented housing, staying with an American family has many advantages. For example, although an ELI student comes to the United States, it is not easy to have a continuous relationship with Americans. A homestay makes it possible to have the relationship ( You want me to correct from 'the' to 'something', but in my opinion, I intend to mean 'a continuous relationship' in a just before line. If my opinion is incorrect, please let me know a correction ).  On the assumption that a homestay host is a normal Pittsburgher who is kind, whenever the ELI student wants to talk such as when they watch TV or when they eat something, he or she can communicate with his or her host. In addition, when they have a question, the host would gladly want to provide help. Furthermore, they can enjoy a party with the owner. When I was an ELS student in Point Park University, one of my friends who is from Japan lived in a homestay. The relationship between my friend and the host was better. She always went with the owner to many parties to which the owner was invited. At the result, she could make many American friends. It is important to meet many Americans because the reason we come to the United Stated is not only to learn English, but also to experience American culture. In addition, compared to a rented house, a homestay is cheaper. ELI students can save money because they can share furniture and many sturff (sorry, but I can't find a appropriate word ) which are usually not expensive and not necessary, but sometimes needed. If ELI students decide to live alone, they have to buy or borrow a lot of furniture which is very expensive. Finally, a homestay might make ELI students feel at home. When ELI students miss their countries and family, they can talk with their hosts who would try to make them feel better.
        Of course, living alone might be more comfortable because people inherently like to have an independent place, which is the most important factor to ELI students who choose living alone. ELI students can enjoy freedom without any interruption and bring their friends home. For instance, they can give a party. In the party, they can meet and make many different countries' friends who understand and share each student's problem in foreign life. It can make them get more close with friends. In addition, one of the most efficient ways to learn English is to make a girl friend or boy friend. When they live alone, it is easier to make a girl friend or a boy friend, because if ELI students live in a homestay, they feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, when ELI students want to do what they like, they can do anything such as sleeping late and returning home late, and they can even go around in home without wearing clothes, if they want.
        In conclusion, Everything related to choosing between a rented housing and a homstay depends on each student's character and lifestyle. Most of all, ELI students have to choose well, depending on their goal in the United States. ",Male,Korean,x

Social Life (family and eating habits)
Education (universities and school levels)
Government system (Politic and economic)


        They always say ""the fingers of a hand don't equal"". The world is one life with different cultures. When I came from my home-Saudi Arabia- to here, I have been finding some issues are similar and others different. I will focus here on the three culture issues to explain some the similarity and differences: social life, education, and, government system.

        From my faith that the most of culture come from the social life, I put it in the beginning. I divided it to two type; families' life and eating habits. In family's life, there several situations are similar such as the people usually work eight hours a day and the parents responsible to take care for their kids. But there are a lot of differences like here the family don't continue his life together like my home. Here people independent after 18 years old. On the other hand, eating habits are most similar. For example, we have three males a day and we eat in a house or a restaurant like here. Maybe the difference is the time of the males especially the dinner that we usually have it after 9 pm.

        The second thing is the education. We have same like here for education system. There are several differences. For instance, we have 12 levels like here but are divided to three kind of school; elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools. Also, we have fewer universities than here that is the reason for increase the number of scalar ship.


        Last culture issue is the government systems such as politic and economic systems. The huge difference is my country has royal system and our king has all authorities and controls on all ministers and government issues. For economy system ia as same as here except there are some rules for own foreign investments.

Finally, on my opinion I can say there are a lot of similarity and little of different between the culture here and in my home that will be coming similar in the future if the world is coming without strangers.",Male,Arabic,"Follow the directions in your text (A, p. 125) for writing your comparison essay.

Obviously, Nowruz is the most wonderful holiday for Iranian people because they meet their relatives, start a new year and eat tasty and delicious foods. 
     First, Nowruz is a great occasion in Iran because people meet their relatives and say Happy New Year to each other. In addition, people receive their guests with nuts, pastries and fruits such as pistachio and baklava. Furthermore, they review their old memories and tell teenagers stories about their life experiences. In addition, adults either buy presents or give money to young children to make them happy and cheerful.
     Another aspect which makes Nowruz more fabulous is that it is the start of a new year. The members of each family cooperate in cleaning the house and preparing it for the special day. For example, one person cleans the windows and another one mops the floor. Moreover, they celebrate the New Year by wearing new clothes and decorating their houses. They put fresh flowers in vases and put them on the tables to make their house look more beautiful and have a nice aroma. Each family sets an elegant table by putting eggs, rice, vegetables, fruits, and our holy book Quran as a sign of thankfulness to God.
     Finally, Nowruz is an amazing holiday because Iranian people eat tasty and delicious foods. Housewife of each family makes a special dish for certain days. For instance, she cooks white fish and rice for the first day, and she also makes an invigorating dip for lettuce on the last day of Nowruz.     
     To sum up, I think you would agree with me that Nowruz is an awesome holiday for Iranians because they meet their relatives, start a new year and get the chance to enjoy tasty and delicious foods. I hope to celebrate Nowruz with my family every year for as long as I live.

33527,ep4,4598,"          Recently, there was news about an earthquake that took place in Haiti. Many people died and missing. This 

disaster reminds me to the deadliest tsunami in recorded history, which hit countries in The Indian Ocean on 

December 26th, 2004 including my home country, Thailand and hometown, Krabi. A magnitude 9.0 quake triggered 

a series of tsunamis killed people in Indonesia, Thailand all the way to India and as far as Kenya and Tanzania, 

Africa. (Economic Impact of Tsunami in Thailand, 2005) More than 300,000 people were killed by the killer waves. In 

Thailand 5,395 people die (Economic Impact of Tsunami in Thailand, 2005), unlikelythe Pacific Ocean, there is no 

alert system covering the Indian Ocean. This natural disaster affected Thailand at least three wayssuch as economy, 

physical damages, and life after the tsunami.

           First, economic impact, Krabi, Phuket, Phangnga, Trang, Satun and Ranong are six cities that were affected by 

the tsunami. These cities are the top destinations for tourists from all around the world because of the beautiful 

beaches and islands. Nine million people per year were attracted by these six cities during 1999-2003. (Economic 

Impact of Tsunami in Thailand, 2005)The state of the economy in these six cities based on restaurants, hotels, retail 

stores, rubber plantations, palm oil, coffee and fisheries. After the tsunami came, it swept away everything, not only 

lives, but also private enterprises. There are reports that the tsunami affected 324 hotels, 345 restaurants, 364 

shops, 4,306 small stools and the total value of destruction to private enterprises was 12,852 million baht. 

(Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Ministry of the Interior, 2005) In addition, tourist confidence of 

security dropped. Caused approximately fifty percent of hotels and tours was canceled,which caused local people 

lose a lot of income. According to the Bank of Thailand (2005), the new estimated number of tourists will be 

decreased approximately 1.2 million compare to the old estimated. Some of the hotels and restaurants were closed 

since the killer waves came because the owner did not have money to reconstruct their businesses. 

          Second, the physical damages took place in many forms such as the loss of lives, damages to homes and 

homelessness, the damages of natural resources.As January 10th, 2005, the death of the victims in Thailand totaled 

5,395 people. Why many people died from this tsunami? Because during November until May every year is a high 

season for tourism in Thailand, and it was almost New Year so many tourists went to the beach and island for a long 

vacation. As much as half of the victims were foreigners such as Swiss, Dutch and Germans while another half were 

local Thai. And as much as 1,500 persons were unclassified (Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, 

Ministry of the Interior, 2005) it was hard to identify especially, people who do not have any tattoo or mark on their 

body that their families or friend could recognize. For foreigners, they have dental records that are useful for 

identification. However, not many local Thai have dental records that are why there are many persons still 

unclassified. Moreover, the number of injuries totaled 8,457 persons.(Department of Disaster Prevention and 

Mitigation, Ministry of Interior) These people need to be transported out of the affected areas to the nearby hospital 

where immediate medical treatment was provided. 

          Finally, the loss of lives has created an enormousemotional impact for families, relatives, and friends. There are 

at least 882 orphans lost father, mother or both. These significant losses caused post traumatic stress disorder in 

children after the Thai tsunami. At Bang Muangschool,there is a report which showed 211 out of 627 surviving 

children exhibit symptoms of mental health risk, and 171 children suffered from loss of one or both parents. 

(Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Ministry of the Interior, 2005) This psychological impact could 

not compensated in monetary terms, but it feel by all. From the same report, there were 42 children not directly in 

the water, but lived in the affected area and know the survivors who showed these symptoms, too. 

Moreover, loss of lives many survivors from the killer waves had caught disease such as Ying, the 25 year old Thai 

woman, caught the ear infection. She still needs to see her doctor every month and it costs 2,000 baht, which is 

difficult for her family to support. (Sareenun, 2007) 

      In conclusion, the impact to economy, the loss of lives, and the mental health are the enormous effects of the 

tsunami in Thailand 2004. Most of the impact took placed in the form of loss of lives, while the economic impact 

was in the form of loss of business. And the mental health of people in the affected areas, their lives will never be 

the same again.

43592,ga1,5801,"Primary and Secondary Education in South Korea: Past and Present

    In the 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama applauded an education of South Korea and encouraged Americans to learn from their examples. The education of South Korea made so much progress so quickly in thirty years. Pedro Noguera, a professor at New York University and director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, said that South Korea was not even ranked among the leading nations for its educational performance twenty years ago, but today, it is near the top and surpasses the U.S. on most indicators of performance. At first glance, the educational systems in the past and the present in South Korea seem so different. However, basic systems and philosophy of the education are not eliminated in thirty years. My article addressed how primary and secondary educational systems today in South Korea compare to educational systems thirty years ago. 
    First of all, one compared aspect between education in the past and the present is an academic year system. Since the modern educational system was established, basic academic years, which are six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school, have not been changed. There is a certain modification in basic school days. Thirty years ago, students attended school five full weekdays and half the day on Saturdays, but now, students attend school on Saturday once in two weeks. Although school days per year have decreased slightly, both basic school year systems of the past and the present are alike. Moreover, since 1979, primary education, including elementary and middle school, has been compulsory. At the age of six, children are admitted to a school in their residential area. Students automatically advance to the next grade each years, and go to middle school when they are aged twelve to fifteen.   
    Another area of similarity between educational systems in the past and the present involves basic subjects, provided in primary and secondary school. The main three subjects are Korean, Math, and English, all of which account for a great part of school time. Other subjects are Science, including Physics, Biology, and Chemistry, Society, including History, Geography, and Politics, Music, Art, and Gym. The importance of each subject is revealed different as the generation went by, for example, English became more necessary, and its class hour is also increasing because world is being more globalized than ever. On the other hand, as the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) has become more crucial to be admitted to universities, Music, Art, and Gym, which are not included in CSAT, became less important than before. In spite of these specific differences, the basic subjects and importance of three major subjects have not been changed.       
    Even though the Korean government seldom modified the basic framework of the educational system from thirty years ago to nowadays, it is obvious that there are some major alterations in primary and secondary education in Korea. 
    One noticeable difference is an evolution of instructional technology. Korea is making various efforts to provide a national information infrastructure in the twenty-first century. Education has also tried to parallel this improvement of technology, and the progress in the adoption and use of information technology in school has been remarkable. Thirty years ago, teachers used only black boards with chalk and handed out directions or assignments written on paper by their hand writing. However, present teachers use computers and projectors as instructional equipment, and sometimes they send emails to let their students know assignments and additional information. According to research, as of 2000, there was one computer per about ten students in primary and secondary schools. By 2001, every teacher had his or her own PC, and every school in Korea was connected to the Internet (ANON_URLSITE). We never imagined this improvement of school facilities thirty years ago. 
    There is another stark difference between the present and the past schools in Korea: the number of students per one class. Thirty years ago, there were about sixty students in one class of primary and secondary schools as a consequence of a lack of schools and a high birth rate. Teachers had to take care of and teach too many students at one time, and consequently, they couldn't pay attention to each student. Conversely, there are about thirty five students in one class in the present schools, which is only half of the past students' number. In parallel with the growth of Korean economy, the government built more schools and enhanced the importance of education; on the other hand, since the birth rate is decreased consistently in thirty years, the number of students per one class is also decreasing.     
     A final difference is a relationship between teachers and students in the past and the present. This relationship is quite crucial to improve students' academic achievement. If there is respect and trust between teachers and students, teachers are happy to help and cheer them up, and students are motivated to keep positive relationships with teachers and do their work well (Davis & Dupper, 183). Thirty years ago, students had to obey schools' rules and teachers' orders, and it was allowed to inflict corporal punishment on students. The old-fashioned beatings were thought to straighten out troubled students and were considered one way to control a considerable number of students in one class. However, physical punishment is now not permitted in school as students' rights have improved. Some teachers feel it is very hard to control students without any corporal punishment because a study atmosphere at schools is getting worse these days. However, it is also considered progress to improve educational systems in Korea. 
     In sum, basic educational systems in 2012 and the 1980s in Korea are alike, and an educational environment has been changed as time goes by. Although basic systems such as school years and subjects of primary and secondary schools have not been altered, instructional facilities were changed to digital gadgets, the number of students per one class has declined, and the relationships between teachers and students has been changed as physical punishments disappeared in school. I think this progress has been made better educational systems than ever, and anticipate a positive future of education in Korea.

13022,fk3,1937,"        Differences between the Hillman Library and Pattee and Pateno Library
Both Pitt and Penn State are public universities of Pennsylvania. We tend to make an easy judge on these two schools' libraries: there is no big difference between them. However, after I moved to Pittsburgh from Penn State and I go to the Hillman Library of Pitt very often. I gradually feel compelled to compare the Hillman Library of Pitt with Pattee and Paterno Library of Penn State in three aspects: hardware, software  and atmosphere (whatever makes people to study in this library). The comparison result is they are very different. Frankly, a library is very complicated and it is related to a large number of aspects. Here what I mention is just covered by my current study activities in these two libraries. 
One important difference is hardware. As far as hardware of a library is involved, it includes the library building, its structure and the arrangement of assistant function parts in it. The building of the Hillman Library is like a cube and very modern. Nearly all its assistant function parts are located in its center, including stairways, elevators and water fountains. On the other hand, the Pattee and Paterno Penn State Library is composed of two separate rectangular buildings. Its non-main functional parts, such as restrooms and stairways are hidden from people's easy sights. On the surface, the Pattee and Paterno Library is not magnificent and very commonly decorated. The different space arrangement of two libraries makes them very remarkably different to readers. On the outside, the Hillman Library looks very large. Actually most of its inside space is wasted by its particular structure. It is obviously smaller than the Pattee and Paterno Library. In the Hillman Library, at least half of the seats are without power sockets. But in the Pattee and Paterno Library, readers can easily find a socket close to their seats. Another thing, the space above the desk in the Hillman Library is not high enough to fit an open laptop very well. But there is no problem like this in the Pattee and Paterno Library.
Another difference is software. Here software of a library refers to its book collection and internet service.. The Hillman Library has 4,908,913 monograph volumes, 50,232 current serials received and 7543846 microfilm materials. The Pattee and Paterno Library has 5,031,196 monograph volumes, 68,445 current serials received and 5,202,694. The Hillman library has more electronic version books and journals. The Pattee and Paterno Library has more books in the engineering, science, business and law,. But in the medicine, the Hillman Library has much more books than the Pattee and Paterno Library. Especially the Eastern Asia Library of the Hillman Library holds much more books in eastern Asia language than the Pattee and Paterno Library. In addition, wireless internet signal in the Hillman Library is not strong and unstable, so readers cannot make a stable internet connection, which discourages readers to use laptop. While in Pattee and Paterno Library, wireless service has been put into practice for several years and there is no problem related to it.
Finally, atmosphere is an important aspect for readers, because it will determine the library of a university is a comfortable place for studying or not. The furniture in Hillman Library looks worn out, especially the chairs and open stacks, which give readers a desolated feeling. Another bad thing is that windows are not clean and the blinds don't work well at all, which distract readers' attention from books. Randomly using cell phone by some readers makes other readers freaking out when they focus on their work. Reading seats and computer seats are very open. Readers are easily distracted by pass-byers. While in the Pattee and Paterno Library, furniture has an enduring surface, which is attractive for reader to take a seat and start reading. Clean carpet and clear windows and other related parts working very well further comfort readers to read in the library. Also there is easily noticeable sign to remind readers of a place in it that is a permitted area for cell phone service. All seats for reading and using computers are well separated. In addition, In addition, The Hillman Library is very noisy because its main stairwell is arranged in the center of the building and the bumping sound of doors is very loud. In the third floor and fourth floor, the floor is paved with hard-surface plastic bricks. When readers drag and move chairs, they frequently make a very annoying noise which affects others' reading severely. Or readers' steps on them can produce a big sound. However, in the Pattee and Paterno Library, all seats are arranged far away from common areas. And all floors are covered with carpet. So it keeps very quiet. 
It is widely accepted that the library of one university is regarded as to be representative of the academic level of this university. Although I am reluctant to accept it completely, the differences between these two libraries I listed here could direct me to draw my own conclusion, there is a lot of room for University of Pittsburgh to improve its library for its readers. However, I was happy to read that ""Among the elite research libraries in North America, Pitt's library system ranks in the top 25 in total materials, ahead of such other prestigious institutions as Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Dartmouth and MIT."" in ""Rebuttal: Polishing the jewel"" written by Rush G. Miller (director of the University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh) on May 30, 2007 ""Post Gazette"".

22972,af0,3095,"Topic:        Is competition important for student?

Should we have to eliminate competitive custom in schools? The world is changing and so is post secondary education. Access to learning opportunities is greater now than at any previous time (Rosenberg, 2000; Voorhees, 2001). It is very important topic in late decade because some parents argue that their children are painful from school. However, the rest of those parents underlie their children to be in a school which has highest competitive because they believe that their children would gain more benefit from this school than another. Developing student learning competition is played crucial role in education system. Therefore, measuring, improving, and providing direction are the results that why students should be familiar with competition. 

It is said that competition in school is harmful to student. Some students feel uncomfortable even gotten sick because of high competitive pressure from a class. They claim that they spend their time to study longer than their parent do on working. For example, majority of worker work for eight hours a day and five days a week but student have to study in a school for eight hours a day and five days a week plus extra classes such as extra course for Mathematics, English, Chemistry, and etc. on weekend at least six hours a week. They study hard in order to get into a reputation school. Moreover, even though student could get into the famous schools, they would pressure from their class mates who are also good at study. It seems student's lives are not easy as what they think. Nevertheless, in the real-life, after graduate life is much harder than the student do today. 

Firstly, competition can measure student achievement. Some students have never known how well or bad they are because they are usually evaluated by criteria-based cut grade and had never been compared with other students in a class. Let's use Thai educational system as an example, Thai elementary school and high school has graded student by using criteria-based cut which graded student from corrected points that student done on a test. Thus, student is not necessary to care about how their class mates' points are. As the result of this point, many students would get in trouble when they pass to study in colleges or Universities. For instance, many freshmen get a low score because most of subjects in undergrad level classes are concerned about professional educations which are graded student by group-based cut grade. Consequently, not only do the students pay all attention on the material in the class but also they have to know how well their class mates are if they would like to gain a good score. 

Secondly, competitive environment will improve students' learning skill. Belfield said ""Competition may improve out comes by raising test score."" (2003). A class atmosphere consciously influence study idea and develop effectively critical thinking skill better than doing alone because of interacting with other students who are good at study. So, they have to enhance their skill to against their peers. For example, many students are graded which based on the group's scores. In this case students must be inevitably forced to do the test as well as they can because students cannot know how good they do will meet the average or highest score. Likewise, work with students who are high or the same knowledge will develop effective critical thinking skill. For example, student probably would know only one way to solve the problem if they did not work in groups. 
Finally, Competition provides a direction of working-life. In working-life, workers are automatically competed with another when they are looking for a job because there are millions of new-workers who graduated from university each year. Since a number of unemployment is higher than available jobs in labor markets, new workers need to have a strong strengthen to get a job. Also, getting in reputation companies is just a first step which is hard as working as in those companies. For instance, I used to work in the number one of Real Estate Development Company in Thailand. At first, I though the hard one is how to get in this company but the fact that is not because I do not only do my best on my duties but also enhance my working skill by taking some courses and gain more another degree. If not, I would have been fired due to there are thousands workforces who would like to play role in my position. Thus, if we learn how to compete when we study, it will more easy to be accustomed in the working-life. 

In conclusion, in order to be success in life, student should be get accustomed with competition. Measuring, improving, and providing direction is important part of competition that we completely take in consideration. Recently, many countries realized that competition is played a crucial role in the global education. They impose some placement tests which graded students by competition such as Entrance-Test, the test which provides for high school students who would like to get into private Universities. Also, governments provide scholarships to influence students for students who are the best candidates. In term of global education, most countries agree with the student-exchange programs which send their students to learn and compete with other foreigner students. These are implicit that competition is very important and settle down in every culture.

22682,gj2,3077,"    Insomnia is a sleeping disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep. It is a common sleep disorder which has adversely effects on daily activity. According to American Academy of Sleep (AASM), 10% of adults have severe insomnia and 30% have symptoms of insomnia. Researchers have tried to solve this serious problem that leads to many undesired effects such as being angry, being late at work or school, decrease attention and etc. Treatment of insomnia depends on the causes of the case and each case has individual treatment different from another. We can divide the treatment into three categories: diet therapy, relaxation therapy and medical intervention.
    Diet therapy is useful in particular cases that its causes related to food or drink. Medical professionals have advised not drink caffeinated drinks and eating chocolate and other caffeine rich products   before going to bed because caffeine interrupts sleeping. In addition, eating fatty meal before bedtime is not advisable due to some bad effects on stomach. 
   The second one is relaxation exercise as a kind of relaxing mind and reducing stress. By reading interesting book or doing relaxation exercise before bedtime are helpful ways to relief anxiety and tiredness after getting back home from hard day. Furthermore, stop thinking about matters that having negative effects on your mood. Also, keep the bedroom dark and quiet and keep away any distracting appliances or electronics. 
  The third one is seeking medical advice if you really need to take medications. Before taking any medicine you have to see a specialist doctor to assess your case and prescribe medicines if there is need to them. There are many drugs that control insomnia with different actions and usages. Many people take mediciene by themselves without standing on specialist recommendation which creates other difficulties. 
  The important aspect of getting good result is to recognize the exact cause of insomnia. After that, you can apply diet therapy, relaxation or take medicines. Finally, insomnia is a disorder with multiple causes as well as different method to overcome this problem.

According to its development, the community of nations is often called a global village, which indicates a united world because national boundaries have been destroyed by developing communication technology. Since the internet was invented, our society has been changed rapidly. However, the change has brought about two different results. In positive way, our life is getting more and more convenient, but in negative way, online crimes, which are not easy to deal with, have been created. 
        The invention of the internet allowed us to take part in the environment of unlimited time and place. For example, systems of checking accounts are proceeding on the basis of the internet. Thus, to check them, we do not have to go to the bank directly anymore. Instead of that, if we access the website of the bank through the internet, we will see the state of our accounts whenever and wherever we want. Otherwise, we have to visit the bank according to the business hours, and it might be inconvenient. In addition, college scheduling systems are being created based on the internet. Since the process of scheduling was changed into a system founded the internet, many students have been able to schedule simultaneously. As a result, it is not necessary for them to wait for a long time to resister their schedules at a school office.
On the other hand, after the appearance of the internet, online crimes sprang from it due to its convenience. First of all, nowadays, we very often surf and save a great deal of information online. However, because the internet is being used all over the world, we need to use the information carefully, and protect our information securely. People sometimes steal or lose their ideas or information through the internet intentionally or unintentionally. For example, when I was in my first year in college, I bought a skirt at online shopping mall. To pay for it, I used my credit card. Unfortunately, my personal information was misplaced at that time. After a month, I got my bill which was charged more than I spent. I noticed that somebody had used my credit card. Actually, the crimes on the internet are not visible, so it is difficult to find the criminals.   
Although new types of crimes were created online, we cannot avoid using the internet because it has already become a part of our life. In addition, it is providing benefits to us. For example, the internet created new types of jobs, so people could have many opportunities to work online. Sometimes, the disabled can work in an online environment because it does not require many movements to conduct their tasks. Consequently, if we use the internet effectively, and try to keep it securely, it will be a much more useful tool for us.",Female,Korean,Write a final (second) draft of your cause and effect essay.

Nevertheless, it was very difficult to adjust to here at first. I came here last august 25th, so I couldn't have enough time to prepare for living here before my school starts. I had many things to adjust to. The most difficult part was speaking on the phone with native speakers. 

My first time to talk with native speaker on the phone was because of IKEA. I bought my furniture in IKEA such as a desk and bed, but there were not enough parts to make the desk. In fact, I had not known that I had to assemble furniture by myself before I bought it. I tried my best to fix it, but I couldn't do anything without the parts. I needed to call IKEA to ask about this problem. However, when I called them, I couldn't understand anything because they spoke too fast. I tried to call them many times but I gave up and I had to go to IKEA one more time. IKEA is very far from my home so it was a lot of work for me.

My second time to talk with native speaker on the phone was Singular service center. After I purchased my furniture, I got my cell phone to contact my family. I went to a store with my Taiwanese friend. We bought our cell phones and decided on our Plan. At that time, I didn't know that my Plan was too expensive for me. Therefore, I called my phone's service center and then asked about how to change my plan. It was just like the situation with IKEA. The service person spoke too fast for me. I told her that I was an international student and I got here just yesterday so please slow down. After that, she spoke slowly but it was just in the beginning. It was hard for me even though the calling purpose was very simple thing to say because I couldn't understand what she was saying.

When I came the U.S, I had many difficult things to adjust to, but the most part was speaking with native speakers on the phone. If I met American, it wasn't too hard because I could see their face and gestures. However, on the phone, they didn't speak clearly and this was big problem for me.

The everlasting festival
 
If the Samurai warriors in the medieval times come to our today's world by time machine, what would most surprise them? Probably, it is the fact that festive ornaments, which originate in their festival 1000 years ago, are still used in the 21st century. Japanese people have long kept traditional events. One of Japanese time-honored events is 'Girl's Festival"" to pray for happiness of girls on March 3rd. Some people might think that the old custom would not be so important in the materialized and realistic society. Is it true? Although the event has changed its form gradually through centuries, it still plays an important role in our life, because of the unique history, the delightful way of celebrating and its meaning.
The unique history of Girl's Festival is our precious heritage showing Japanese tradition. It dates back to the Heian Period 1000 years ago. There was a ceremony among the nobility to pray for the perfect state of health in March. They were blessed by a diviner and floated paper-dolls down rivers to drive away bad luck. This thought of shifting bad luck to dolls still remains in regional customs here and there. The ceremony had developed into a present form, mixed with a fashion of elegant dolls and crafts over several centuries. In the Edo Period, today's gorgeous types of dolls were formed about 400 years ago. At that time, the festival became popular not only among upper-class but also among lower-class families all over Japan. The festival represents our piety, the delicate art of work and fashions of the time. 
The delightful way of celebrating unites family members though the festival. Parents prepare for traditional foods such as diamond-shaped rice cakes, sushi and clam soup, which are thought as symbols of health and prosperity. All family members enjoy eating these foods together. They display well-dressed dolls representing the Imperial family of the Heian Period on the red- carpet tiers inside the house. The miniature dolls and accessories like swords and hats are elaborately made and children carefully display them in right places on the tier, according to parents' advice. Parents explain to children about the history and each doll's role. Decorating these is the greatest pleasure for parents and children. It offers opportunities to communicate within the family.
The meaning of Girl's Festival stands for the eternal wish of parents throughout the ages. The festival is to celebrate the healthy growth of the family's girls and to hope that they will be blessed with children in the future. Every year parents take the set of dolls out of a closet a several days before the day of Girl's Festival in order to celebrate it properly. When it is over, the dolls are immediately packed into special boxes in order because we have a superstition that girls have difficulty in marrying in the future if they delay putting away. Parents' attitudes toward the festival make children recognize that they are loved. Through the festival, parents' wish has been certainly passed down from generation to generation. 
In conclusion, Girl's Festival is of great value in our modern life, which represents our tradition, enhance communication between family members and pass parents' wish onto the next generation. Once aware of these points, you will appreciate that the festival is indispensable for us.

(Indent)  McDonald has been opening in all over the world include in many cities in China.  The first McDonald appeared in the U.S in 100 years ago as a small Hunberg's restaurant.  Today, we can find a McDonald anywhere in the U.S., also McDonald developed abundance of restaurants oversea.  The first McDonald in China was opened in Beijing in the 1990's, but few people ate there.  ""We never hope that many Chinese people, especially for adults, go to McDonald fluently, buy we believe that the children's eating habits will be changed by McDonald"" said the president of McDonald.  They really achieved it.  McDonald in China is more popular than in the U.S.
(Indent) Even price of McDonald in China is little higher than a traditional Chinese fast-food restaurant, it is cheaper than in the U.S.  In the U.S., one meal for a customer will be cost $4.00 to $6.00 with free refill a drink.  In China, a customer goes to a fast-food restaurant that would cost almost $ 1.00, but if they go to McDonald, it usually spends $ 3.00 to $ 4.00 per meal without a free refill.  However, more and more Chinese prefer to eat at McDonald.
(Indent) The cost of the food in McDonald isn't most important factor for the customers in China, so many Chinese go to McDonald for eating.  McDonald in China has more customers at eating time than in the U.S.  For example, McDonald usually set up 10 or 15 tables in one store in the U.S., and most time if you go McDonald, it is easy to find a table.  However, if McDonald usually set up more than 30 table in one store in China, and if you go McDonald during the lunch time, you may wait for a long time.  On the weekends or holidays, it would more difficult to find a table.  That doesn't mean that a number of the restaurants are smaller.  The fact is that eating in McDonald is a kind of fashion in teenagers in China.
(Indent)  Play place and toys in McDonald attach children so much in China.  A play place for children in McDonald is one of the reason that children like eat at McDonald.  Sometime they don't want to eating anything but they must play at play place long times.  In China, when the child enters the McDonald, they will go to play place first and their parents yell at them several times after they may go back a site and eat some food.  In U.S., children like McDonald's play place too, but they may not go to McDonald just for playing.  McDonald is so popular in China in order to some children like their birthday party in McDonald.  They will give the child a special cook and a toy.  The parents like go to McDonald sometimes because a babysitter in McDonald can help them witch the children and play some simple games with the children. I didn't see a babysitter in the U.S.
(Indent) As a restaurant from the U.S., McDonald has been successful in China recently.  They caught the customers' eyes and change the younger's eating habits. When McDonald was be judged in the U.S., more and more Chinese have been going McDonald.  The reason may be that McDonald for Chinese is new, but McDonald in China will earn more money than in U.S.  That is true.

13616,dz9,1937,"For women, marriage is a turning point; after it they decide whether to work outside or stay at home. Some wives want to have jobs even after they have children because they want to go out into society. On the other hand, some wives think wives should be at home, do housework and spend much time with their children. There are major three differences between a housewife and a working wife: economical situations, the time with their children and the way in which they feel about housework.
The first, there is a big difference between housewives and working wives in their economical situation. Housewives don't have jobs, so they can't help their husbands support themselves. The family economically depends on the money husbands earn, and they sometimes need to worry about the cost for their children's education. If the money husbands can earn is just enough to live, the family can't afford to spend some money for their children. Moreover, some wives have to ask their husbands when they want to buy something expensive. Because all money the family has is from husband's working, wives aren't allowed to use money freely. On the other hand, working wives can earn money and they can support themselves. The family can have at least a little more money compared to that the family of housewives has. Working wives can earn money by themselves, so they don't have to get permission of husbands to buy something they want. 
Second, the time they can spend with their children is very different between housewives and working wives. Housewives can have enough time to spend with their children. They can be with their children all the time after children come back home from the school, and mothers can listen to children who want to talk about the school with mothers. Children who have housewives as a mother don't feel lonely because mothers always stay by their side. However, children whose parents are overprotective often lack self-reliance because they can always rely on their mothers and they don't have to be independent. On the contrary, working wives don't stay with their children all the time. Because mothers leave home for work, some children have to spend most of their time at a nursery school. As a result, children sometimes feel themselves alone. However, children having working mothers can become independent early because they realize they need to do something they want on their own. 
The last big difference between housewives and working wives is the way how they feel about housework. Housewives think that housework is their duty and they make a lot of efforts to improve their home. They learn cooking and try to make wonderful meal for their family. In addition, they spend a long time cleaning up their house. They try to do their house chore perfectly because they think it is their job as housewives. In that situation, their husbands don't think they have to help their wives do housework. On the other hand, working wives think housework isn't their important part of life, so they try to spend as less time finishing up housework as possible. Even though the house isn't completely clean or dinner is the same as the day before, they don't care about that. Their husbands think housework should be shared with husbands and wives because they both have their jobs. They try to do housework together to make their life smooth. 
There are some differences between housewives and working wives. They sometimes feel uncomfortable when they talk together because their ways to feel about their job or housework are quite different. Housewives consider their way of living to be the best way for their family, and working wives are also proud of their role in society. The important thing is they have to recognize the advantages or disadvantages of staying at home or working outside, and they should think what is the most valuable thing in their family life.

23975,au6,3287," How to Get a Driver's License at Pennsylvania as an International Student

 Nowadays, it is very common for people to drive a car everywhere, especially in America. The car is considered as essential part of life. However, to drive a car, you must have a driver's license. The driver's license can be used not only a permit for driving a car, but also an identification in the States. However, if you don't have a driver's license, you don't have to worry. There are three steps for an international student to easily get driver's license: preparation of necessary documents, a driver's test on a computer based system, and an actual driving test on the road.

 First, you have to collect documents for the driver's test. The things that you can collect for yourself are a passport and an I-20. You also should complete the application form, which is in the guidebook. In addition, you must get a reject letter from the Social Security Center and a letter that prove that you are a university student. 

 If you collect all these documents, you can go to the next stage. You should study the driver's test, which is executed by a computer based system. There are total eighteen questions, and you must solve at least fifteen questions. If you miss four questions, you will fail the test. However, you can take the test again from the next day. There is no additional cost. On the other hand, if you pass the test, you have to pay a fee by a personal check. Once you pay the fee and get a ""learner's permit"", you can make an appointment for your road test.

 The last stage is to take an actual test on the road. You should go with your friend or parent who already has driver's license. Also, the car should be ready for your driver's test. Before you take a driver's test, the supervisor will ask you how to manipulate the car such as high beams, low beams, and so on. Then, you will drive the car with the supervisor according to his or her instructions. You have to stop at the stop sign, and check the left and right side before you go. I think that the part is the most important in the road test.
 
 It is little difficult and complicated for an international student to get a driver's license in the United States. In spite of that hardness, I recommend you to get a driver's license. Even though you cannot buy a car, driver's license can be used usefully. For example, you can rent a car and travel many places without the transportation. In addition, everywhere in the United States, driver's license can be used as identification. Therefore, do not hesitate to get a driver's license and do not give up getting it. If you follow the steps which I explained, you definitely get the driver's license.

2089,do6,190,"There are two nation rooms in the Cathedral of Learning named the Early American room and the Syria-Lebanon room. Both are ancient and were owned by wealthy people; in addition, the University of Pittsburgh bought them the long time ago and has been cared of them for many years. In spite of these similarities, there are lots of differences between them, such as the purpose of rooms, their decoration and furniture. These dissimilarities show us how different were these two cultures and customs.
The first aspect is the purpose of these rooms. The Early American room is an example of New England kitchen-living room in the 17th century with the hidden bedroom above the fireplace. This is an example of living space for wealthy Americans people of that period who needed to have warm home and protection from Indians. Unlike the Early American room, The Syria-Lebanon room represents a kind of living room for meeting people, and also for the religious purposes. People who had owned this room before the University bought it did not need to warm it, so we cannot see any heating system there.
The second aspect is the decoration of these rooms, which is in contrast based on the purposes of these rooms. Due to the Early American room's purposes are living in cold climate and protecting the family from negative events, animals or Indians, this room has very simple decoration. Everything is made from wood and handmade bricks. There is no fancy decoration in this room. In contrast, the Syria-Lebanon room has rich painted decoration. Walls and ceiling were painted with a special technique, which made the room looks very beautiful, colorful and rich.
The third aspect is furniture in these rooms that also is different. The Early American room has simple furniture, such as a big, wood dinner table, simple design wood chairs, metal dishes in the fireplace for cooking, and a bed with night table in the bedroom. In contrast to the Early American room, the Syria-Lebanon room has luxurious, costly furniture. There is some furniture in that room, such as a silk carpet on the floor, sofas, and small coffee table with coffee china set on it. 
The Cathedral of Learning has many nation rooms, but these two rooms are very different from each other. There are differences in the purposes of these rooms, decoration, and furniture. Nevertheless, these two rooms become interesting illustrations of living habits of the people who had been living in the 16th -17th centuries. Also, they represent two different cultures, and when we are looking at them we can imagine life in the past.

8924,cp8,1384,"Defined as a structural or functional abnormality of the heart, heart diseases affects and causes to die many people. In the United States, more than 60 million Americans have some form of heart diseases and about 2600 people die every day because of these diseases. Along with there are many reasons of heart diseases,obesity and lack of exercise, high blood cholesterol and smoking can be accepted as the most considerable causes.

First of all, lack of exercises and obesity leads to unhealthy lifestyle that causes heart attack. By keeping away from oily foods, doing exercise such as walking, running and aerobic is necessary to avoid heart diseases. When we exercise, our heart beats more rapidly, the arteries widen to provide more oxygen and arterial blood flow improves. Nowadays, most people work inactively in a fixed place and need to do much exercise. People who are overweight, for example, are less inclined to exercise. Prosperous people who have leisure time are more likely to exercise than those who must work long hours. Besides, dietary factors may make people less inclined to exercise. According to researches, lack of exercise, accompanied with food habit and obesity, is one of the causes of heart diseases. This counsel must not be forgotten: ""Energetic life maintains healthy life and helps to throw away harmful substances from the body.""

On the other hand, smoking greatly increases the risk of heart diseases. According to the American Heart Association, more than 400,000 Americans die each year of smoking-related illnesses. Many of these deaths are because of the effects of smoking on the heart and blood vessels. Researches have shown that smoking increases heart rate, tightens major arteries, raises blood pressure, and can cause irregular heartbeats, all of which make your heart work harder. Although nicotine is known the main detrimental matter in cigarette, other chemicals and compounds like tar and carbon monoxide are also harmful to heart. These chemicals negatively affect vessel walls and cholesterol level and can lead to a heart attack. If it is quitted smoking, the risk of heart attack decreases and higher blood pressure lowers to normal.

A third cause of heart diseases is high blood cholesterol. Cholesterol, a fat-like substance carried in your blood, is found in all of people's body cells. When we eat animal foods like meats, eggs, and dairy products, extra cholesterol enters our body. Because the main reason of cholesterol is the saturated fat in food, nutrition labels are read carefully. As a result of motionless lifestyle, cholesterol, especially LDL-bad cholesterol leads to heart attack and death. Therefore, we must check our cholesterol level and avoid eating some food including animal production.

Consequently, even though there are a lot of major factors, lack of exercise, smoking, and high level cholesterol are three main reasons of heart diseases. According to the scientific researches, these diseases influence and cause to die thousands people every year. Hence, we must take notice of our hearts carefully.

                  A Funny Story


During my college time I attended a lot of classes that where pretty much similar in the sense that nothing strange or unusual ever happened. Nevertheless, one day in my algorithms class something quite funny made the entire class start talking and laughing without control. We were all sitting and paying attention when the teacher announced that we had a special guest that day.  The guest arrived, presented himself and started talking about the class subject. Soon, everybody was murmuring, which is consider to be very rude in my country, but no one could help it. The whispering was followed by a soft laugh. I guess all the students knew what was going on, when near the end of the class a student raised his hand and the guest very politely said he was glad to answer his question. So, the student said the most unexpected thing: ""Well I was wondering if you could close your pant's zipper, I can't see your underwear!"" It was the most hilarious situation ever! The man blushed in just a few seconds and everybody in the classroom was laughing without any restraints.  It was something very unlucky for the teacher, but what could we do?? no every day someone walks in to give a class with an open zipper!

Today, every country has own forces, and is maintaining military balance each other to protect their countries and world peace. Recently, I wonder how many people of the world know the fact that Japan is the only country that is abandoning any forces. Since 1946, the Japanese constitution has prohibited all fights against other countries including self-protection. However, in fact, there are ""forces"" in Japan, named ""Self-Defense Forces"". In addition, they have been sent to Iraq to help American Forces from December 2003 to June 2006. After that, many Japanese politicians claimed that we should amend the constitution to fight against other countries to protect our country. And now, Japan is going to lose own peace constitution before long, although there are many opponents. I am also one of Japanese pacifists, and I suppose that finally all countries in the world should abandon their forces. This opinion may sounds like an impossible dream or a ridiculous story, because probably everybody will think, ""If we have no army, who protects our country?"" Therefore I present three practical arguments about significance and possibility of the renunciation of the world's forces: the danger of the strong forces, the problems about the global environment and natural resources, and the transition of the world's ethics.
First, I think the strong forces always have a big risk of causing the war, even if their initial purpose was only the defense. Although it is a common idea that we need weapons and forces because we have to protect our country and ourselves, historically it is almost impossible for a country that has the strong forces to control it completely and peacefully. If a country got a great army, it is very difficult to repress the desire and use their power only to domestic problems. In addition, this situation will be more complicated especially in modern countries with capitalism, because not only national benefit but also individual profit will be involved in the problem. Actually, the war is a big business for some people. For this reason, I think that an arms cut can prevent the war.
Second, in a global vision, reinforcement and maintenance of the strong forces are huge waste of money, human and natural resources. Nowadays we are faced with many global problems, including environmental problems and the exhaustion of natural resources, and the cooperation among all countries is necessary to solve these problems. For the foreseeable future, the world's balance will dramatically change, because we will become to live with much harder environment and not be able to use oil. The unemployed will increase due to a decline of economy, and mortality rate would increase due to environmental pollution. We should spend more energy and money for the earth to prevent the miserable future, and the military budget can become a good resource.
Third, the world's ethics will continue changing to the future. In the past, big countries always tried to increase their countries more and more, and many small countries became colonies. It was necessary for every country to have stronger forces than the other countries, and an aggressive war was the only way to keep a nation's prosperity. In the present days, there is no country that starts a pure aggressive war, because global criticism has much power to control a countries behavior than before. However, it is not enough yet. Consequently, war is still continuing in many countries with their own complex reasons. Therefore we need the forces to protect our country from enemies. But In the future, the world's ethics should be more advanced. All problems between countries could solve by international diplomacy. Economic sanctions would become more effective and practical than the attack by forces, and we wouldn't need any forces.
In my ideal state of the world, every country has no forces, and we cooperate with other countries to protect the environment of the world. The military budget spends for national welfare and ecology. I hope to believe it, but of course, the real way is so hard and so far. I am hearing the news about the war everyday. However, some day, a country might give up the forces as a start of the world's true peace. If it would be Japan, it will be my great pressure.",Female,Japanese,persuasive essay...

22200,bf5,3022,"   Nearly one-third of all employees spend at least a few hours a month lamenting about their bosses. It was the same in my case; I had two similar jobs, but I had completely different attitudes about them. At first, I wasted a lot of time complaining about my job, although I liked my tasks and social environment at work. Finally, I decided to change jobs and I found a place that I really enjoyed every day.  I discovered that the secret was my new supervisor. If you are going to start a new job, you should be also aware of the characteristics of a good boss. That can make a difference. After I analyzed the similarities and differences between the qualities of both my managers, at last I understood which characteristics make employees happier and more effective at work.
   At first glance, it seems that both my managers have a lot in common. First of all, they have nice personalities. My first boss is as understanding, responsible, and honest as my most recent boss. In addition, the first supervisor treats the whole team equally. Likewise the last supervisor treats the entire team fairly. Both managers don't ignore poor performance and don't accept incompetence from employees. Most importantly, both supervisors are good accountants, which I admire. My first boss has a strong knowledge about the business, and my most recent boss too. Both of them represent a high level of professionalism. 
   If I take another look, the comparison between both my managers shows some surprising differences that make me aware of why I was unhappy at my first job. In terms of personnel management, more employees appreciated the management style of my most recent boss. While my first boss never gives workers fair reviews on time, the other gives regular feedback, which contains useful information for an employee and an employer. For example, one a year he gives information about the performance throughout the whole year, which helps to indentify weaknesses and potentials of employees. Moreover, I become more aware and also I pay more attention to qualities, such as confidence. Unlike my first manager, my most recent manager has a lot of self-confidence, confidence in the business' future and confidence in the workers. A good superior has to maintain command spirit among the staff; he must be the engine of the business and he must inspire the employees by personal example. Whereas my most recent boss has all those characteristics, the first boss didn't. The most important factor for me is the ability of my boss to support employees in their career developments. My most recent boss takes care not only of everyone's priorities and helps individuals understand their contribution to organizational goals, but also he listens to what is important to employees as well. In contrast, my first boss didn't do any of that. While my most recent head of our department encourages the employees to grow within their careers, my first head of our department was concentrated only on his own career. He manipulated his employees to make them work overtime without extra money in order to do work for his tasks.
   In conclusion, after taking everything into consideration, I finally know what kinds of qualities are important in a good boss. I definitive prefer my most recent boss because of his management style and strong self-confidence, and particularly because of his ability to support his employees in their individual careers. He understands that the satisfied workers identify with the company and they work more efficient. Many people are unaware of their preferred working styles and expectations about a supervisor. Thus, it is up to you to figure them out and take an advantage of this knowledge in the future, as an employee and maybe someday as a manager.

2688,fx9,331,"        Last month, my husband and I went to Key West in Florida and the Bahamas. After we got Key West, we went to the public beach in front of our hotel. Swimming in the ocean was one of things I had been looking forward to, so I went into the sea without any hesitation, but my husband didn't. He told me later that he had a hunch. In fact, something bad happened to me.
As I went offshore, I felt a bit uncomfortable. I didn't know the exact reason I felt that way, but maybe the reason might have been that the sea didn't have see-through water. When I saw a blue object floating in the sea, I thought it was a plastic bag. I was looking at it for a while, thinking he or she shouldn't have thrown it away into the sea. When I took next step forward, I felt my legs hurt so much. I got a sudden and clear understanding about what happened. I was stung by a jellyfish. The blue plastic bag, which I thought it was, was a blue jellyfish. I was panicked and didn't know what to do. I'd never been stung by a jellyfish, so I had no idea about the treatment. I just got back to my husband, got rid of parts of the jellyfish that was clinging to my legs and put a bag of ice on my legs. Maybe I should have asked a hotel staff about the treatment I should have done, or I could have searched the Internet to get some information about the jellyfish and the treatment. If I had done those, it might have given some difference on the stings. Moreover, I could have retreated from the sea when I saw a ""blue plastic bag."" I even could have stayed with my husband without going into the sea, or maybe my husband could have told me that he had a bad hunch. Maybe I should never swim in the sea. I could swim in a pool and might listen to my husband hunch next time.
After Key West, we visited the Bahamas. Our hotel had an aquarium which was huge and so beautiful and had various kind of fish. I was so excited about seeing it. At the time, I was walking along while seeing fish and holding the card key of our hotel room, which made us not only enter our room but also buy things and food in the hotel because we'd registered my husband's credit card number on it. Maybe I was too excited, so when I got in front of lobsters' tank, I noticed that I didn't hold it. I was panicked because that meant the same as I lost his credit card. We looked around everywhere we walked to find it. We went back and forth the same place over and over. However, we finally couldn't find the card. We went to the front desk and asked her to make the card invalid. If I had been more careful, I might not have lost it. Maybe I should have put it in my bag, at least in my pocket, or I shouldn't have been too excited like a child and should have taken more grown-up actions. Phew, a lot of regret. What a trip it was. I should act more calmly and never hold a card key while walking around. I should not hold any keys and could ask my husband to keep them. Anyway, I should pay more attention to my security.

Do you know how many times people use public transportations in whole life? According to statistic, a city dweller uses them around 44,000 times. Public transportations are inherent part of city. Every city has different public transportation system. For example, some cities has subway, others do not have. Korea and Pittsburgh share some common public transportations such as buses. However there are also different transportation system. Personally I prefer to live in Korea because of Transportation Card system, and subway-bus system.

In Korea, there is convenient transportation card system. This uses a smart card containing much information to reduce additional processes to ride public transportation such as buying a ticket, giving it to driver, etc, so people can save much time. Citizens just make their card touched to small recognizing panel, and use all public transportation. The biggest advantage of this system is enabling to trans-ride to other transportations without paying extra money. For instance, if there is a person who took subways and this person need to take bus, all this person hate to do is just putting his card to the bus-recognizing panel. Then, card read information about what he took, subways, and this give him permission to take the bus without charge. On the other hands, in Pittsburgh, there is no such card, but there is ID card. People having student ID can take bus freely. Students wanting to take bus show their ID to bus driver, and driver let them in. However, if there are people not having student ID, they have to pay charge. In this case they would have problem, when they want to trans-ride, because they have to pay every single time when they take buses.

In Korea, there is subway system. This subway infra is very well organized, so Korean use subway more than buses. Moreover, as I mentioned before, because of convenient trans-ride system between subway and bus, subway system is popular. Subway routes are looks like spider nets, so people can go anywhere by taking subway. In addition, it goes under ground and use only electricity. Therefore it conserves our on-ground environment. However, in Pittsburgh, there is only bus system. Routes of buses are not efficient to transport people. Sometimes people have to take several bus-route. Moreover buses use fossil fuel generating hazard gases.

All in all, Korean and Pittsburgh's transportations have some differences. Transportation paying system, and subway system are different. Convenient public transportation system makes people glad to live in the city. Therfore I think Pittsburgh need to develop its public transportation more convenient.",,,paste your essay below

Do you think being a student is very happiness and they don't need to worry about anything? In my opinion, I don't think being a student will be always happy and don't have any pressures. Sometimes, being a student is very tiresome. Moreover, now there is more and more survey that cites: many students admit that they want to suicide or they had tried to suicide. I think there are three main pressures of being a student: their school grade, their behaviors, and their future.
One of the primary pressures sources is the school grade. I think most of students agree that school grades are very important for them. And to get good grade, they must be studying very hard. For example, students have to spend a lot of time to studying for get good grade from test. Besides, students need a lot of time and energy to do their homework. Moreover, if their want get the good grade, their need to pre-read and review the skills and text that teach at class.
Second pressure is their behavior in the class. If you can't get along with your classmates well, it does really make you feel upset. Besides, if your behavior is bad, then your teacher and classmates won't like you. Therefore, you have to distinguish what kind of behavior that you should and shouldn't do.
The last but not the least pressure is student's future. You need to think what kind of job that you want to do? Or what kind of things that you want to do? Even more, what kind of person that you want to be? But, most of time, things aren't going well as you thought. So, there will have many problems on students' future, and students need to try many different ways to solve problems.
In brief, being a student is not so easy, because students have a lot of pressures. They care about their school grade, their behaviors, and their future. And I believe, sometimes these pressures make students feel upset, frustrate, and sad. Now, do you still think being a student is happiness, and they don't need to worry about anything? I think students need to learn how to make them relax, such as, doing some exercises, going shopping, or taking a rest. Besides, I also hope students are more happy and fun while they are studying.

At that time I had a health insurance but I was a new in the Unites States. I had no idea about the policy in the hospital. I went to the UPMC to get some medicine, as usual I always have favor, I went there and I told them I'm sick and I gave the my health insurance, they accepted me to give me medicine because my government was supposed to pay the cost. One month later, the UPMC sent a bill for me to pay. It was less amount of money around $210. I sent this bill to the Saudi Culture Mission because they are supposed to pay it. As usual, they ignored he bill. This problem of sending bills had continued until I received a real warning bill from the recovery international debt collection. They asked me to pay plenty of dollars otherwise; I would be judged in one of the government. They gave me few days to send a check to the centre of debt collection in Switzerland. The only one solution I had was to pay this much amount of money. The amount was around $800. Imagine that from $ 210 to $ 800. Finally, I paid $800 via wire transfer. After the payment, I became poor. I didn't have enough money to pay other utilities so, I depended on my sister and brother in law to feed me or help me. That's was the worst money experience I have ever had in my whole life.

24143,cz9,3346,"Studying in The United States of America is a good idea but, at the same time being an international student is hard. There are a lot of pressures of being an international student. For example, most of the international students they face a lot of problems like finding a proper apartment, language barrier, different culture, homesick, money issues, friends, Visa issues and policies,etc. In my opinion, I think that the most important pressures are language barrier, money issues and homesick.
        The greatest pressure is the language barrier. For example, it is requiring talking an English test to attend any University in The States. In addition to that, there are only two types of English tests either: TOEFL or IELT. Also, you have to learn the American way of teaching i.e. you should know how to write an essay and how to take notes,etc. Because, The English tests are only testing your English but, does not prepare you for studying; to do that you have to talk an English classes in any English Institution. Nevertheless, international students spend more time studying comparing to American students in any subject because; they have to translate the word. 
        Another, pressure is money issues. One of the issues is the currency, because you will probably loss some money when you exchange currencies. For example, if you transfer money from your country to the United Stats in this case you will pay transfer fees and foreign exchange. Another, money issue is the living in The United States of America is more expensive than some other country. For example, the apartments in Saudi Arabia are cheaper than The United States of America. In addition, there are a lot of expenses for international student such as: university tuition, apartment rent, bills,etc. Furthermore, international students have to have a back up money; which means they should keep some money in case of anything.
        The last, pressure for the international students is the homesick. There are a lot of reasons that makes the international students feel homesick. For example, they are usually missing their family and their friends. Also, making new friends is difficult some time because of the differences in cultures and mentalities. 
        In conclude, language barrier, money issues and homesick are the most important pressure for international students. Because of, these pressures I think that the universities in The United States of America should help and cooperate with the international students.

6465,ft9,1063,"          The benefits of learning English
   One of the most essential ways to open to the world is learning a new language. Learning a new language and especially the English is so important; because of the so many benefits you would acquire, such as: using the modern technology, gaining more experience, and communicating with people around the world since English is the most common understandable language among so many countries. 
       Using the technology requires the people who understand and deal with the English language. For example, the Internet, if you do not know English, you often can not use the Internet and the services that are given, such as: the email, search for something, and knowing the news in the world. Therefore the technology whether in the Internet or in the other fields demand learning English. 
       The second reason of learning English is to have more experience in the life. For instance; usually if you want to have a job, one of the questions you are asked is if you speak another language and especially English. Also you will have more experience in other fields, such as: when you meet new friends, and when you travel to any country around the world.
       The third incentive of learning English is to communicate with the people around the world. For example, traveling, and studying. When I came to the United States to study, I knew exactly what the benefits of learning English is and how it is so important to be able to understand English when you are traveling and studying. Therefore, traveling and studying are two types of communicating with other people but there are so many others, such as: having a new job, and meeting new people.
        Finally, I think that learning English will be ongoing and developed in all countries around the world. I think also that the advantages of learning English will increase more than using the technology and having more experience in communicating with people.

  First, Comedy is one of the most enjoyable style for people. There are varied styles in comedy. Especially there are three main comedies which people love. Including slapstick, there are romantic and black comedy. For example, as we see the first slapstick comedy, the actors and actress show hilarious atmosphere by hitting each other or falling down to the floor. Second, the romantic comedy is one starts and stops in a way with the theme of love, between a man and a woman. 
Next, the black comedy is the story about a social satire. Usually, the performers hint censure of the society in their acting. Therefore comedy can be thought one of the most popular styles that evoke laugh from person.
 Second, theme of melodrama is mainly love. There are also various kinds in melodrama as like family melo, crime and psychology melo. Family drama treats a broken family. For example, there is a conflict of a parent-child relationship, crisis of a middle-aged man that is called Male Weepie Movie. It's instance include <East of Eden, 1955>, <Kramer Vs Kramer, 1979>and <On Golden Pond, 1981>. In psychology melodrama is literally expressed a psychological description of human. We can be examples <The Phantom of the Opera> and (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, 1958) of Richard Brooks. Next, the crime melodrama is mainly combined with relationship of crime, or sin and fateful love. As example, there is <A Summer Place, 1959> which  was directed by Delmer Davis.
 Third, Animation that was at first made for children also can be divided a countless genres. Among them, there are Drawn animation, cel animation and doll animation. First, Drawn animation means that these are created by hand-drawn like animation of Walt Disney. For instance, <Tom and Jerry>has been loved to children until now as eternal classics. Next, unlike Drown animation expressed with planar, Doll animation is constructed three dimensional space. The most important things in Doll animation are production of doll and set. According to objet of doll, various works can be outstretched in front of a spectator. Objects are also very diversity, such as wood, clay, plastic, chemical material, cotton and so on.

4442,es9,558,"When I studied English, sometimes I didn't have enough time to do homework, memorize a lot of words, and prepare for a test. Then I thought that if I manage time well, I can have enough time to study. I found three good ways to manage time so I'm going to introduce to you: review everyday, discuss homework and difficult vocabulary with your friends, and use your free time to memorize words or to practice taking notes.

First, review is the most important thing. You don't have to invest a lot of time to review. When the class is finished, you should read the textbooks carefully and remind yourself og what you learned in class. You should try to do it everyday. It helps you to manage your time effectively because if you do it everyday, you can remember more easily than when you study a lot of things in just one day. For example, imagine that you have a vocabulary test tomorrow. If you haven't reviewed, you may invest a lot of time to memorize and study everything in just one night. In contrast, if you have done it before, you may just read your vocabulary lists or check your notes to find words you want to study more. Then you will remember most of them. In this case, you can finish preparing for the test quickly. Reviewing helps to manage time directly.

Secondly, discussing homework with your friends is also good way to manage your time.
When you are doing your homework, sometimes you may get in trouble. You try to solve the problems and you may invest a lot of time, but it doesn't work. What can you do? You should try to talk with your friends and ask them what they think about the problems, or if they already solved them, how they did it. After you ask them, you will solve the problems. For example, when you can't find the meaning of a word in a reading, your friends can explain the meaning, why it is, and some clues from the reading. SO next time you have some questions on your homework, you may want to discuss them with your friends so you don't have to waste your time.

Finally, if you use your free time, you can save time. For example, when you watch TV, you can learn almost everything that you hear. You should use that time. While you are watching TV, you can practice taking notes. You can also practice your listening skills at the same time. Another thing is to read something when you ride the bus. While you're riding the bus, you can read books or even vocabulary lists. Just read the words again and again, and you will memorize the words naturally.

These three things will help you to manage your time effectively. You should manage your time effectively so you can complete a lot of things in a short time. If you review everyday, you will be ready for the test in no time. If you discuss homework with your friends, you will share a lot of information as well as solve problems such as difficult words. If you use your free time by watching TV or reading books, you will learn a lot of things, such as vocabulary, with out spending much time. So you should try at least these three things to manage your time, then you can study English more effectively than before.

English academic writing is one of the most important subjects in college doctors like to read clear essays and creative by a lot of knowledge . In my experience English writing depends in three aspects that can improve academic writing Grammar, vocabulary and Unity.


First, grammar is the key that can open the essay and make ideas clear . It can help the doctor to make a vegan about the essay and can assess the students skills. For instance, if I am writing a presses essay I should have the ability to use past simple ,present perfect and present continues to can draw a big image in the readers mind. Grammar can control and organize the essay specially the process essay.


Second , the words that student choose in the essay reflects student background   about what he is writing about , also it reflects the attention  of the details . For instance, in the sentence "" It can help the doctor to make a vegan about the essay and can analyze the students skills "" I used assess instead of the word evaluate because it can demonstrate the same meaning , but asses in my opinion is more appropriate.

Finally , the unity of the essay is what can make the doctor realize clearly the student skill, of giving examples and definitions about the same topic . For example,  writing details are not relevant to the topic or the controlling idea can effect the essay negatively or be run on some times. usually unity can help the reader to focus and enjoy the passage.

First, because students of the ELI came from more than 14 different countries all over the world, each student has to use English to communicate each other. If most part of students came from single country, students likely spoke their own mother language to communicate among the students. In this case, English progress of the students would be inhibited, since they loss their opportunity to speak English. "" I can make a friend from many countries, and I can get an opportunity to speak English,"" Milla said. Second, the activities outside the campus offer the students much an opportunities to learn English. In fact, there are many activities in the ELI, and the activities are just on the increase. Finally, the ELI has not only a single course like speaking but, all of English learning course including speaking, listening, writing, and grammar courses. This is an important point to note that Taking all these 5 courses would lead the students to fair and non-biased English progress. Actually, the largest group of the students, 66.67%, took all of 5 courses at a same semester. For these three reasons, it is naturally led to a conclusion that the ELI is on of the best institutes to study English as a foreign language.

27718,dn0,3770,"          With the globalization devoloping fast, exchange cultrue, technology, intellegent technicist has become a popular trend. No matter personal, group, or company, most of them choose to study abroad to absorb advantages of different country. Nowdays, students make up a high percent of people who go abroad in China. Even though to go abroad is a chance to challenge one's own ability, to be succeesful needs to face a lot of pressures.
          Why do students want to go abroad? Study is students' first task. Go to university fo international students is their promary purpose. Because english is not their language in many countries. learning english is a hard word to do. In order to ge college admission, students suffer prssures also from parents and friends. Parents considered their child's age. Child should save time to learn english. For student self, they usually compare with their friends. They worried how fast they can go to a good university as others. Besides the TOEFL score, a good university also requires SAT for a bacholor degree. Master degree needs TOEFL and GRE or GMAT. SAT and GRE are also difficult for an english speaker. Obviously to see how hard it is for an international student.
          Because of the global economy crisis, many countries such as the USA canceled scholorships for undergraduate international students. Study expense needs to concered. Intenational students pay more money than American citizens. Rate of exchange money among many countries have big disparity. As a result, foreiger study in USA requires more money. Study fee have third times higher.
          Normally, people should prepare english one year if they want to study abroad in a good universiy. Time makes international students depress. To pass English exam is not easy business. Expense is high, save time become a direct way to save money. Especially when the pressure from parents comes. On the other hand, students also don't want to become when they are entering a university. So, most of them will save time to graduate in three years. These students carn credits as much as they in each semester.

          Pressures makes people nervous. Students need to relax when they have free time. If international students can dal with their pressures, it also can be a propulsion for them to achieve their objetives.

Thinking in this way, some researchers of the Psychology Center of the University of Pittsburgh began a research about happiness's reasons, thus they believe who will be able to help many people. In this direction, some elements have already been discovered, such as familiar relationship and success in the work or university - depends of   actuation's field of the people who were interviewed. Also, another aspect was seen by the scientists engaged in this work: all people at a least aim for happiness is an enhancement  in the health and love. 

The issue from the first block - family an friends - explored the degree in which the social and familiar relations enrich the happiness. Thereby, as far as the people have a satisfactory relationship between friends, parents and siblings, they are increasingly near of having a life more joyful. Preliminares data appoint 92% percent of all people gathered in this research said that are happy and likewise they have a good  relations with their family and their friends (work, neighbored or university). Then, the happiness resulted in relations improvement of primary degree. Thus, family and friends became the main recourse to reach happiness at all. 

Another component searched out to belong a structure from work and study. Data from the second block demonstrated how relations in both ways became important to improve the people's happiness. The success in area of actuation has an effect on people's happiness. Therefore, if a people managed to achieve professional success, they fatally have a life more pleasurable.

The internet has affected our life in many positive ways. This can be seen in the way we learn, work and communicate.

         In education, the Internet has brought new ways to help with the learning process.  Information is now easy to find. For example, if a student wants to know more about something, the easiest way is to Google it, and the related material will appear on the screen of the computer in less than a minute. In addition, universities and schools benefit from the Internet by creating an online library that contains electronic articles and books in a variety of subjects. Thus, this helps students doing their research and assignments. 

Another positive effect of the Internet can be seen in the way people work. Now employees can work anywhere anytime, not just at their offices. For example, when you do not finish your report and you have to go home by dinner time, you can complete it at home and send it online by email later at night. Moreover, international organizations and companies can have overseas meeting with their brunches located on another countries by having online video conferences. All these became available because of the Internet.

        Now people can communicate and know about their families and friends faster, easier and cheaper than before. The only thing you need is to be connected to the Internet. Moreover, many social network websites have been created to share all kinds of information with others, such as Facebook and Twitter. Also, video calls can be done online. For example, the father can see and chat with his family while he in the job trip by using Skype. Hence, wherever you go you can check and see your love ones in easy and fast way.

        In conclusion, the impacts of the Internet are many and it has changed a lot of things around us. Searching for information, working, and social communicating have become faster and easier than before.

 Nowadays, it is very common for people to drive a car in everywhere especially in America. The car is considered the essential part of a life. To drive a car, you must have a driver's license. Driver's license means not only a permit for driving a car but also an identification of the States. However, if you don't have a driver's license, you don't have to worry about that. There are three steps for you as an international student to get easily driver's license: preparation for necessary documents, driver's test on computer based system, and actual driving test on the road.

 Firstly, you have to prepare a bunch of documents for the driver's test. The things that you can prepare for yourself are a passport and an I-20. You also should complete the application form that is in the guidebook. In addition, you must get a reject letter from Social Security Center and a letter that can prove that you are a student from the University. If you prepare all these documents, you can go to the next stage.

 Secondly, you should study the driver's test that is performed by computer based system. There are total eighteen questions and you must solve at least fifteen questions. If you miss four questions, you will be failed the test, and you can take a test at next day. There is no additional cost. On the other hand, if you passed the test, you have to pay the fee not cash but only a personal check. Once you pay the fee and get a ""learner's permit"" card, you can make an appointment for your actual test.

 Finally it is the last stage to take an actual test on the road. You should accompany with your friend or parent who has already driver's license. Also, the car should be prepared for your driver's test. Before you take a driver's test, the supervisor ask you how to manipulate the car such as high beam, low beam, emergency flash and so on. Then, you will drive a car with supervisor according to his or her instruction.

 In short, there are three steps to get a driver's license. When you finish to prepare all necessary documents, you can take a written test on computer based system. If you pass the exam, you will get a permit to take an actual test on the road. After you go through the road test successfully, you will be able to get a driver's license. If you follow the instructions step by step, you will definitely acquire the license

For example, many teenagers and some adults spend a big part of their time in social networks like chats, messenger or facebook.  The second way in common is having disorder.

Concern, which is natural and helpful to take care of children, has to be always with belief.

Second, the parent, who can wait their children until they stand themselves, is the ideal parent. Some parents overprotect their children not to get hurt. But hurt and failure are important things. The children whom parents don't overprotect can be strong for living themselves well. And they can be people who succeed without parent's help.

But a good way to do it can be seeing their scores or grades. In this sense, the students can be divided into three different types: excellent/good students, bad/horrible students and unclassifiable students (this type will be explained later).

The first type is the good or excellent students. Of course, this kind of student gets the best grades every time, in every class or subject. They always have the homework ready, and they really do not seem to have problems or unpleasant surprises. But in this group, you can also separate them into two different subgroups. The first one is the one that involves excellent students, but also with a great character. They are humble, and they try to help other classmates in the best way they know. Their attitude in class is participative, and they allow the rest of the class to participate, too. The second subgroup is the people who are smart and work hard, but their character fails. It means that they are absolutely proud of themselves, or what is worst, they suck up to the teacher and try to show themselves like a wonderful student. Those who are too much proud try to dominate the class, and they can be a big problem for the learning of the rest of the students. 

The second type of students is the bad or horrible students. It is a real fact that they are more than it should be. These students do not do homework, their grades are poor and the improvements are insignificant. Their attitude in class is annoying, and when most of these students are joined in the same group, the correct speed of the lessons and explanations goes down. The rest of the students are disturbed, and as a result this situation drive the teachers mad.

And finally the third type of students, which can be called the unclassifiable type. This group can be divided into two different groups, too. One of them joins those students who are able of get either the best or the worst grades. It depends on the day, the inspiration they have, their motivation the day of the test, etc. They are really smart, (many of the best genius of the History could be included in this group), but they only apply their knowledge whenever they want. And the other group are drastically different, but it must be added in this third type in the sense that they are also unclassifiable. It includes the students that have a good attitude, they work so hard, but unfortunately they are completely lost. They do everything wrong and do not understand nothing at all. When you see one of these students, you can avoid asking by yourself how they got such a level, without any knowledge, to be in the same class that you are, and feeling sadness about them.

In conclusion, there are many kinds of students, such as bad students, good students, genius or lost students, and the best way to classify them into three general groups can be using the most classic method applied by all the teachers, their grades and final results.

26869,ej5,3770,"Although most people dream to study abroad of their home countries to see a new world and have a good opportunity to absorb a high education, being an international student is very stressful and could result a lot of pressures; most the problems that could face any international student are money, time and language.
The main problem is the money; most of the international students enrolled in a full time study program and it means not allowing them to work which make living at a decent level and affording the essential needs are very hard. For example, you have to live in appropriate and a safe place, pay utilities bills, buy grocery and clothes, pay cell phone and internet bills, the cost of the fuel and paying the tuition fees of studying; due to all these obligations the student could get confused and make it harder for him/her to concentrate comparing to the resident student. 
Second, time is the most frustrating factor for any full time student who lives in a foreign country specially to whom has a family responsibilities such as taking care of children, cleaning the house, cooking and buying grocery, calling the family back home, paying the bills, doing the homeworks, studying and accomplishing the requirements that universities asks for applying; by all that you find your day is full and you have no time to relax or having the benefits of being in a beautiful city.
Third, studying a second language is the main goal for any international students to achieve all their pursuits. For instance, the student in the U.S should be fluent in English so he/she can communicate with people, studying a certain degree, work internationally and can use the computer programs easily; but in order to acquire that the student will face a lot of challenges like getting a high score in TOEFL and struggling with the GRE .

4331,ak0,551,"        Lebanese and the United states have very different diet when it comes to food.
These cuisines are well-known in the world as very tasty cuisines.  Every one of those is popular in some kind. But Lebanese foods are healthier than American food because it consists on vegetables, especially fresh vegetables, homemade and doesn't contain a lot of fat.  In contrast, American food is greasy, delivered by fast food chains with a little bite of vegetables.
  
Lebanese, throughout the history, are hard working people, who work as a farmers, and plant their vegetable and grain in their back yard. In the other hand, American are more industrialize, and they live in an active society where rarely people can find time to cook at home.  Lebanese diet is healthier because it contains a lot of vegetables, fruits, grain and milk.  Milk is the source for many Lebanese traditional dishes such as Lebanese cheese, labneh, and yogurt.  But American diet is more about meat, chicken, chips and pizza.  This could be healthy but if you cooked in a special way not fried or bought in a big portion.

Second, how people prepare their food plays an important role in its rank as healthy or not. American diet relies on fast food chains, already prepared food, or deep fried food.
This way in preparing can have a severe consequence on the health. Also it can lead to medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, obesity and a lot others.  Unlike Lebanese food which is cooked in a healthy way.  Lebanese foods are prepared grilled or broiled. Lebanese rarely fry food.  And it contains less fat and calorie comparing to American food.  That is why a lot of studies showed that American should give up their unhealthy food or try to make it better.
 
Third, Lebanese food are usually homemade food because preparing them needs a lot of time.  Usually housewives prepare a main course every other day and family gather around the table, in this way; people make sure that the food is healthy and clean also fresh.  American rarely eat at home, their favorite food are KFC, McDonalds, and burger king.  When they prepare food it might be something fast that fit with their schedules, because in every home, normally parents are at work and they don't have a lot of time to spend on cooking.

For all the reason above, the consistence of food, the fat percentage in this food and its preparation, I think that Lebanese diet is healthier than the American diet. The diet helps the Lebanese do live a better life and to prevent many diseases.

                                                       Plane Changed Our Lives
When you want to go to another city what is the first thing that comes to you mind. It must be 'I need to get a plane ticket'. You cannot imagine a life without plane. A businessman may say 'I spend most of my time on planes'. In old time people use trains, boats or horses while in modern society we can't survive without planes. What planes bring us were convenience, global business and safety.
Since plane were invented people can go to almost anywhere in a very short time. It is unbelievable convenient. Before there were planes people spent months to cross ocean by steamer. We all know how danger the ocean is and how helpless people will be when they are trapped in a storm. Even they finally crossed the ocean they may get lost already. Imagining the first people that found the American I have to say they are so lucky that after months or years on the sea they found what they needed successfully. Unfortunately not everyone had that luck. I believe travelling across the sea to see a new world was an impossible thing to most people in old time. However even using train to travel in land is not that optimistic. In order to use trains to travel around people need to spend a lot of money, time and labors to build railroads first. If there is a place that has many mountains the job will be incredible hard. After the railroads were built they still need regular maintain and that will be another big expense. Another trouble with train is that most people cannot tolerant the boring on a train especially in a long trip. However things changed after we had planes. When I came to the U.S. from China it only took 16 hours by plane. I know it is a little bit long but I almost crossed half of the earth which took months in the past. You may say we need to build airports to make the whole thing work but don't forget we have helicopters which are widely used in some place that so not have big airport. For example they can land on the top of hospital which means they save patients' lives. You can tell the big difference between with and without planes.
The use of planes promotes the global business. In old time business was limited in small areas because it was hard for people to communicate from long distance. Also it was impossible to transport commodities that easy to spoil like fruits and vegetables. In old time of China people used horses to transport silk and porcelain to other countries but definitely not America which was too far from China. They couldn't bring too much products because they needed to bring food or clothes and they travelled a long time. That was the reason that the price of these silk and porcelain were much higher than jewelry. I figure that wouldn't be a good business for general people. In contrast, we have global business today and we can transport anything we want. A businessman in New York can plan to sign a contract in the next day in Japan and don't need to worry about he cannot go back to spend weekend with family. You can buy the freshest fruits from other countries almost in very supermarket. What is better is that the prices of the import commodities are more acceptable because we have planes. Otherwise the planes also support the travelling business. People have never travelled that much like now in the history. You can go anywhere you are interest in Australian, Canada or Europe and you won't be unpleasant due to tiredness of long travelling. The planes do make our lives colorful.
Finally not as most of people think the plane is the safest vehicle. You may hear a lot about the crashes on newsreport but the percentage of it is pretty low comparing to other kinds of vehicles. It is true that when people thinking about travelling by plane the first thing comes to them is the crash. However the reason is not that plane is unsafe but is almost no one can survive from a crash, so every crash is so impressive that there is no way to forget them. However do you how many people dead in accidents every day. It is even the first reason of death in China. We also have a lot of train or boat accident. The most famous one is the sinking of Titanic. Who can predict that this great boat sank on its first trip? However sea is more powerful and dangerous than sky. You may think there is bad weather in the sky just like on the sea, but plane flies in the stratosphere where there is no air moving so there is no bad weather or even a little wind. In addition there are strict policies about flying. The staffs work in airport check every plane carefully every day and won't let them go if there is serious weather. I am not saying there is no danger to take a plane but the possibility that you get a crash is very small.
In sum, the plane has a lot advantages and makes our lives better although it use oil which is not good. Maybe one day we can find another better energy for it. However no one can deny that we need plane very day. It makes our life convenient, makes the global business easier and it is the safest choice if you want to travel. When the first plane came out it could only fly 10 minutes. This 10 minutes do changed the history and totally set human free.

On the other hand, I've been in Pittsburgh approximately for 6 months. Let me tell you some prencipal things about Pittsburgh that could captivate you. This is the city where is really quiet, safe and secure. Moreover, it is the city that has the least criminal rate in  the US. Yes, the one that you heard about the weather is terribly true. This city has substantially inconsistent weather. Whereas it could be unbearably hot, you migh always have to carry your umbrella in your bag in case raining. However, I think it doesn't affect you to not to come here after you learn that, Pittsburgh is named twice ""America's Most Livable City"" and likewise one of the magazine has put Pittsburgh atop the list of American cities for its quality of life. I hope you got some ideas from the advice that I gave you based on my experiences. Thank you for your asking ",,,"Dear Writing 4M,

I have a dilemma and need your help.  I've decided to go to the U.S. to study English before I go to graduate school, but I can't make up my mind about where to go.  I could study in San Francisco, but I'm afraid of earthquakes and there could potentially be a major earthquake there any time. Alternatively, I could go to Pittsburgh, but I've heard that the region experiences severely cold winters and stifling hot summers.  There are many other factors to consider, such as the professional sports teams, the cuisine, the friendliness of the people, and the cost of living.  I'm writing both you in Pittsburgh and students at another ELI in San Francisco to get your perspectives.  Please give me your advice based on your experience of living in Pittsburgh.

Thank you,

Xavi from Spain"
