According to Koeppen's Climate Classification, Fao-SDRN,   Agromenteorology Group-1997, "" These desert climates are found in low-latitude deserts approximately between 18° to 28° in both hemispheres. These latitude belts are centered on the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which lie just north and south of the equator. They coincide with the edge of the equatorial subtropical high pressure belt and trade winds. Winds are light, which allows for the evaporation of moisture in the intense heat. They generally flow downward so the area is seldom penetrated by air masses that produce rain. This makes for a very dry heat. The dry arid desert is a true desert climate, and covers 12 % of the Earth's land surface.""  It is undoubtedly true that the climate effect people several ways. For example it effects people's emotion, countries' economy, and people's clothes style.
The first affect is people's emotion. One of the most important reasons of being optimistic or pessimistic is climate. The range of optimistic people in America is above world's average because America has wonderful climate. Thank to wonderful climate American people look future with great happiness. Unlike American people, England people are almost pessimistic because of rain. The weather of England usually dims so England people can not get sufficient sun. The range of pessimistic people in England is above world's average.
On the other hand, climate effects countries' economy. Some country's economy depends on agriculture, other one depends on tourism because of climate.   For example, wheat harvest need warm climate for this reason you can not plant wheat if you live in cold climate or in hot climate. Some countries' climate suitable for planting vegetable and their economy depends on agriculture. Addition, if some counties have hot climate and also have a lot of beaches their economy depend on tourism. 
Another affect is people clothes' styles. Some people have to wear boat, coat, hat, and glove because the climate is so cold. They need these clothes to survive their lives. Although some people have to wear coat, some people prefer wearing shorts because they live in hot climate areas.
In conclusion, it is true that there are many climates on earth and climate that influence people's life and we can not change the effect of climate. Therefore people have to adjust  climate where they live.

33521,ah5,4480,"The Effects of Self-Medication in Brazil
 
""All things are poison and nothing is without poison, only the dose permits something not to be poisonous"" (Paracelsus, 1493-1541). In other words, the difference between a medication and a poison is the dose. This is the main problem in self-medication and the principal reason behind numerous deaths every year in Brazil. Self-medication is the use of medications without a prescription or medical advice. According to the World Healthy Organization (WHO), more than 10 percent of medical hospitalizations are attributed to reactions or side effects of medications. In addition to that, in Brazil, every year 20,000 people die from the wrong use of medications according to the National System of Toxic-Pharmacology Information (Sinitox).  The principal reason for these deaths is self-medication. Data from Abifarma (Brazilian Association of Pharmacies) show that around 80 million people consume medication without prescription or medical advice in Brazil. According to WHO, some effects of self-medication are: delay in diagnoses, wrong treatment, incorrect administration of the medication, use of the inadequate dosage or excessive dosage, excessive or short period of treatment, addiction or abstinence symptoms, potential side effects and allergic reactions, bacterial resistance, and interactions with other medications which the person have taken. All these effects listed are hazardous, and can lead to complications, as well as, death.
Thus self-medication can disguise or delay diagnoses, especially when the disease show acute symptoms. An example of that is the use of OTC medications, such as Prilosec (Omeprazole) to treat heartburn. Even though the symptoms decrease or stop, the real disease, which was the cause of the symptoms were not discovered, and also, the diagnostic of a possible gastric or intestinal tumor was retarded, and consequently, could lead to a poor prognosis of the illness.
Consequently, potential side effects caused by excessive use of medications can be harmful and cause serious health problems. For example, an abusive use of painkiller medications such as Tylenol (Acetaminophen) can cause liver failure. Usually, people who take medications for treat pain or fever can take an excessive dosage of acetaminophen due to the use of different medications containing the drug acetaminophen. As a result, people can have increased the total dosage and, due to the toxic effect of acetaminophen in the liver, liver failure can be induced.
Otherwise, in Brazil, it is possible to buy antibiotics without a prescription in some drugstores. According to the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (ANVISA), 50 percent of antibiotics are sold without a prescription. Consequently, self-medication is stimulated and, because of that, people have trivialized the use of antibiotics. Usually, the treatment does not follow guidance and as soon as the symptoms stop or decrease, the parents stop given the medication for their children. As a result of the wrong use of antibiotics, some bacteria can become resistant and the treatment can be ineffective in the future.
The use of natural medications made from plants is very popular in Brazil. However, being natural is not similar to being safe. Most Brazilians believe that taken natural medication is secure and totally safe. Subsequently, people commonly make the mistake of exceed the use of these products doing self-medication. Several kinds of natural medications are potentially toxic for some organs such as the liver and kidney. Some of them can cause abortion, bleeding, and death is possible.
In addition to that, interactions between medications are typical when people do self-medication, especially with elderly people. In general, elderly people take prescriptions medications for chronic diseases, and the use of other medication without prescriptions is typical. According to Marianela Flores Hekman, President of the Brazilian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics  (SBGG), self-medication can cause destabilization of the treatments of chronic diseases and toxic effects. According to her, 44% of 2,019 patients admitted to use medications without medical advice.  
In 2009, the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (ANVISA) was especially concerned about self-medication, in particular, the use of painkillers and fever reduce medications. These kind of medications can disguise and delay diagnoses of H1N1 flu. The H1N1 flu is a new disease and according specialists, diagnoses can be misinterpreted when people take medication without prescription for release the symptoms of a common flu. In result of that, ANVISA suspended advertisement of this kind of medication in Brazil in attempt to reduce the consume of these drugs.
In the final analysis, self-medication induces tremendous effects in people's health and is an enormous public health concern in Brazil. Around 80 million Brazilians use self-medication to treat their diseases and because of that, numerous side effects are generated. The most important effects are disguise symptoms, diagnosis delay, and interactions between medications. All these effects can culminate in poor prognosis and death. However, the real statistics of the effects of the use of medications without prescriptions are not accurately known because of the difficulties in collecting information and reporting the problems to ANVISA. The Brazilian government needs to emphasize the importance of the correct use of medications and give information to people about the harmfulness of self-medication. In addition, the government needs to provide access to doctors and hospitals to minimize self-medication.

which affected the economies in all countries around the world . One of the 
direct consequences of that recession is unemployment , which has social , 
economic and political effects on my country. 

Unemployment has a strongly negative influence on the society in Syria. It results in many catastrophic effects ; such as, raising the delinquency rate among people who can't find a decent job to earn their keep ;  increasing thefts ; poverty and drug addiction due to the frustration caused by looking for jobs in vain.All of which undermine the infrastructure of the community due to the increment of divorce cases and displacing more families. Unemployed parents tend to argue and quarrel because of the mental and psychological uneasiness caused by the feeling of helplessness.Since the budget barely suffices to feed the
family , children become victims of this ordeal. What will life be like to the children deprived from education and other rights that a child should have ?

As for the economic consequences, bankruptcy is considered one of the biggest 
problems that are related to unemployment.Bills keep coming 
regardless of  whether you have a job or not .As a result of bankruptcy ,
people can't pay car or house payments which leads to foreclosure. How will the future be to The young educated generation ? Those who spent bulk of their lives studying and hoping to fulfill their dreams in becoming effective members in their society , unfortunately, are shocked by a bitter reality when they can't even get a job that pays the minimum wage. This disappointment incites them to migrate abroad looking for better opportunities ,Bearing in mind that the majority of them stay there.This brain draining prevents Syria from taking advantage of their skills.

The third consequence is politics related , and it is represented by the 
pressure applied to the government by the people due to the lack of job 
opportunities and depletion of financial resources .Governments 
are expected to face any crisis and treat it with suitable means of

drastic changes .The minister of treasury resigned as a consequence , and the ruling regime was close to be overthrown . 

It's clear that the effects of unemployment are hard to eliminate , but they 
could be reduced by implementing a wise plan to reassess the 
economy in Syria and revive it .Creating new investments and reinforcing the banking system is a good start. Immigrants can also be motivated to come back by

    Let your brain be like a sponge. These were my teacher's words when I first met her. When thinking about these words, I realize how important it is to absorb information, learn from other's experiences, keep educating myself, and stay open to the world around. Now, allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. I have always dreamed of becoming a successful person. I have been ambitious since I was a child. If I want to achieve something, I simply plan for it. Planning, Organizing, leading, and controlling are four secrets that I have used to achieve my goals. I've used these elements in every part of my life. They have become essential parts of my personality and I believe they will help me in my career. In fact, I have learned the importance of these elements when I studied business administration at the university.  I still recall the professor's advice. These words that have influenced me, when she said: ""The four elements or functions in any successful management are: planning, Organizing, leading, and controlling"". 
    The first key to success in life is to plan for it. I've always known this secret and used it all the time. When I put a plan, I state my objects .I evaluate my resources, my abilities, and the outside factors that can affect my decision. Taking all these things in consideration has helped me to manage my life.  In addition, putting a scenario for what may happen in the future contributes in helping me to predict the potential risks, measure them, and be prepared all the time. I believe that planning is an essential concept in the field of management and having this skill will help me to success in this field.
    In addition, organizing is an important element which relates to planning. After I plan for something, I organize my resources. I identify the actions and the tasks that need to be done to achieve my ultimate goal. A simple example for the use of organizing in my life is organizing or managing my time. Like any resource, time is very important and it plays a vital role especially in the field of management. I believe that my extensive education in the field of business administration has made me more aware of the importance of time. In fact, I have learned that time is as important as the financial resources or the human resources. Being aware of the importance of time has helped me to increase the efficiency in achieving my desirable results.
    Moreover, another necessary skill that managers need is the leadership skill. From my perspective, the successful leader is the one who sits directions and guidelines for others to accomplish the organization's goals. He listens to others, realizes and appreciates the importance of their opinions, and knows when to use these opinions. I realize the importance of the leading skill and the influence of good leaders on the job quality. I believe that my ability to work under pressure, encourage myself, encourage others, listen to them and persuade them will help me to become a good leader.
    Nevertheless, none of the previously mentioned skills will work effectively without the use of the controlling function. Controlling means making sure that goals are being achieved according to the plan, and making corrections if needed. This skill has helped me to stay on the right way because I always have feedback about my performance.
    Finally and in one word, Planning, organizing, leading, and controlling are four skills that have helped me to success in life and I believe they will help me to success in my career. In addition to that, I always try to improve myself because I strongly believe that that we are not separated from this world, and in light of the rapid progress in society, people who don't advance will retreat back.

24792,dq9,3426,"A House or An Apartment, Which Would You Prefer to Live into?

The article Easy Living Sherpa write: ""Owning a home has been romanticized and called the ""dream"" of every American.""(Easy Living Sherpa, Wednesday, June 17, 2009). It's evident that everyone yearns to possess a house or an apartment. In people's whole life, most people will spend their half life time to stay at home, in where we enjoy with our families, we feel delighted and leisure by our private space. We will feel free to do our favorite relaxations. A satisfied house or an apartment can cheer you up. However, a house or an apartment, which would you prefer to live into? That will depend on your economy, your lifestyle and the housework you will have. These three aspects will affect your decision.

One of reasons that people give for not owning a home is they feel that they don't have enough money for a down payment. Houses are too expensive or they don't feel they have good enough credit. Buying and owning a home takes more work than renting. (Easy Living Sherpa, Wednesday, June 17, 2009).  Almost houses will spend your huge money to buy. Even you have bought a new house, the following things that you have to think about are yard, decoration and furniture. These also will spend you a considerable amount of money. Comparing a house, an apartment will be cheaper to buy. Because the area of an apartment is smaller than a house, the spending of decoration and furniture will be less, and you do not have a yard, so you will pay nothing for it. If people pay great attention on the money problem, they would prefer an apartment. Personal economic condition is one aspect that affects people's preference. 

Another aspect is personal lifestyle. People have varied personal lifestyle. Some like to be quiet, some like to live with others. If you live in a house, you will have a wide, private living space, a yard and a parking space. You will be free to do anything that you would like. You don't need to worry about disturbing your neighbor when you sing or vacuum or have a party in your home. You also don't fear to be disturbed by your neighbor. On the contrary, living in an apartment, you always care about whether your action will annoy you neighbor. You still mind that you are annoyed. For example, I am living in an apartment, my neighbor is a young lady. Sometimes, she comes back home very late at night, when I fall asleep, she comes back home, then I awake to the sound of toilet flushing, walking and washing. If you live in a house, you certainly do not suffer this. If you like quiet, private living environment, to buy a house is a good choice. 

The finally aspect is housework. It's obvious, living in a house, you will involve in a amount of housework. You need to mow and water your glass, to root out the weeds, to trim trees, to plant flower, to paint the wall of house and so on. All these labor work are hard and bored, but you have to do. If you live in an apartment, you will be free from these chores. You will have a lot of personal leisure time to entertain. If you are weary of this housework, you would prefer an apartment.

Living in a house and living in an apartment both exist in advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, I think the economy, the lifestyle and the housework that you have to do are main aspects that will be the determinant which influence your decision.

17462,bm5,2521,"             
              Fragmentation of land describes breaking up of the land into small parts available for farming. On the other hand collective farming has different meanings in different prospects, one of the definitions is ""a system of agricultural organization in which farm laborers are not compensated via wages. Rather, the workers receive a share of the farm's net productivity"" (ANON_URLPAGE). And the other one ""Collective farming is when a group of farmers pool their land, retaining as private property enough only for the members' own requirements. The profits of the farm are divided among its members. In cooperative farming, farmers retain private ownership of the land"". There are two types of collectivization which are forced and voluntary collectivization. I am with voluntary collectivization in which a farmer who has most of the land in a particular area either buys the land from the other farmers or they unite for collective farming to get better production. For instance, Pakistan, an agro based country, got independence in August 1947 and Pakistan's total land area is about 7, 96,096 square kilometers and about 60 percent of the total land is used for cultivation. Though, after the independence the area and production has increased but it is not as increased as it should be. For many years, under Pakistani law, man's land is divided according to shares between all his inheritors after his death. This means that a fair sized land is divided up, and this process will continue in the next generation; ultimately, there would be large number of independent owners trying to make a living out of very small land. In my opinion, we can get better cultivation, enormous production, increase availability of land, and reduce transportation expenses with collective farming.
        Collective farming can play a key role to get better cultivation and agriculture not only matters in feeding 140 million people but also has importance in industrial network from where raw material is obtained. It is termed as the engine of national economy and also provides as an index to measure development and progress. The scientists can play an important role in socio-economic uplift of the country by utilizing their capabilities particularly in agriculture sector. It is manageable for the agricultural experts or scientists to jointly overcome the problem, method of farming, and inefficient farming operations. It is easy for the experts to handle the problem in time before it's too late. This will help in their research as they 


are able to research more accurately.  Collective farming also facilitates growers in the perfect and   better use of fertilizers. Improper use of fertilizers is a common problem in Pakistan. Farmers want to ensure good yield, and apply unsuitable and so much fertilizer that much of which goes wasted. Fertilizers have played a key role in helping farmers to achieve their high level of production. Fertilizers provide essential plant nutrients which are vital for producing enough and healthy food for the world's expending population. What type of fertilizer should be bought and applied? The answer to that question is not an easy one. For example, with the use of inorganic fertilizers we can not only considerably increased cultivation but also save our environment with the harmful effect of fertilizers. The use of modern technology is another source to increase the production. Without the use of modern technology the declining land productivity with reduced crop yields has been also a major problem facing our farmers. It is difficult for every farmer to utilize the modern technology in the developing country like Pakistan. For example, Hi-tack systems offer tractors that operate without drivers, no one is rejecting that technology is changing the face of the world. Tomorrow's technology will bring wide changes to every industry, including agriculture, and may one day make it possible to do business and control production without a great deal of human labor.
        In my opinion, it is the obvious effect of collective farming that we can easily get more land for farming. One can have the experience that the collective farming causes dramatic changes in the physical appearance of the agricultural land and its availability. When an agricultural land is divided continuously generation after generation, every family has built a separate house for itself and for the cultivation of land; different means of irrigation are established for every separate piece of land. Irrigation means the accessibility of water for farming. New canal, passage, and channel for the supply of water occupy the land and trim down or decrease farming resources.
        Being an agro based country; better production of crops is always the question mark on us. We can solve this problem with collective farming in the following ways. Due to the illiteracy about the farming and deficiency of funds available for farming, our farmers are not able to choose the good 


quality seed. Lack of research in the field of agriculture and fragmentation of land are the causes of low production. According to the Model Farming by Nasar Ali shah and Dr Umar Frooq in Pakistan ""generally big farmers are the first beneficiaries to new technology, whereas, medium and small farm households are usually unable to benefit from the new technology. A majority of poor farmers avoid taking risks in adopting new technology until and unless they are sure about its benefits"". Sometimes, farmers rely on their own seed that they save from the previous crops but they do not pay attention for the preservation of the seed and this will become another reason of low production after the plantation. I think that the corporate farming is a similar way of collective farming which is widely utilized by the developed countries and are getting enormous amount of food and agricultural production. Corporate farming not only provide a desired amount of agricultural products but also the entire chain of agriculture related business, including seed supply, fertilizers, food processing, machinery, storage, research, transport, distribution, marketing, advertising, and retail sales. The main advantage of corporate farming is to get the food with increasing population. We can produce crops at low cost and we can make it possible the accessibility of the food to all people.      
        In the developing country like Pakistan, the transportation of agricultural products is a big problem because the increasing rates of petrol and diesel are made it difficult and increased the cost. Collective farming helps the buyers to get a large quantity of crops on a one spot instead of collecting different places. It makes the easy approachable for the buyers and lower the cost by saving the natural resources. The farmers may also get benefits because it lessens the role of the middle man. Middle man means the person who buys the crop from farmers and after that sell crop to some mills or factories. When a large quantity of crop is available on one spot than it is convenient for both parties like mill owner and farmer to contact each other. Sometimes it is also possible for the farmers to export their product internationally. The government can provide transportation facilities to these collecting farming areas for the proper and timely transportation of goods. In this way the farmers may get more reward of their hardworking.   


        It is concluded that collective farming is a good idea in a country like Pakistan. It is manageable for the experts and scientists to watch and to research. This research may lead to produce new varieties of crops that are resistant to diseases. Farmers can save the money utilized on pesticides. We can increase our production with the ease of increasing population by the use of fertilizers and modern technology appropriately. As the population of the world is increasing rapidly so it is pertinent to increase the production of food materials for eradication of hunger explosion. More land is available for farming and it is easy to transport. Agricultural land should be used only for cultivation not for housing projects. The more collecting faming is, the more food production will be. I think collective farming would be first choice of every country because of its importance.

Obesity becomes a problem for American children. According to the article written by William and published in CNN in 2006, 17 percent of children in the USA between 2 to 19 years old are overweighed. Actually, this high percentage is considered as a warning sign to encourage researchers to do more studies about children obesity. There are a few reasons that lead to the fast spread of childhood obesity: insufficient information in different types of media, bad eating habits, and insufficient physical activity. 
First of all is information about food that children can see in media. More than two third of all TV advertising of meal, which children can see, is advertising of high-calorie and unhealthy food. About it on European congress on obesity the Australian specialist declared on the obesity Bridzhet Kelli, based on the research conducted in 11 countries. ""Leadership on advertising of unhealthy food belongs to Germany and USA where products occupy 90 percents of market of advertising of meal. Australia and Great Britain appeared on the last place, in which harmful products are advertised in the half of all rollers about food"", she said. Presently in the whole world about 177 million children and teenagers to 18 years suffer clinical obesity. From them there are 22 millions - children to five years. Obesity entails the enhance able risk of origin of heart-diseases and diabetes. 
Another reason, why children have an over weight is eating of too much food. A habit to have an overeating arises up very quickly, the delivered from it is difficult, and for a little child - it is practically impossible. The point is that at overcooking of food different hormonal matters appear in a duodenum, many of which on a structure and operating on an organism similar with Morphine. An abundant meal stimulates formation of similar matter, weakening, state satisfied, complacent, pacified comes as a result. A child gets used to bind any problems.
The third an major factor, resulting in development of obesity, is low physical activity, when even a normal amount of the accepted food is surplus, because calories, entering organism with a meal, are not burned in the process of the physical loadings, grow into fat. To do that a child anymore moved now very difficultly! Most parents blame in this video and computer games, and also the Internet. All these things result in the assiduous way of life, while parents would wish to see the children more active. They go to school after that return in 16:00 and settle down front of a TV or computer.
Finally, focusing on the causes of childhood obesity, solutions for this problem should be implemented. The government should initiated plans and support local programs financially to reduces excessive weight among children. In addition, school should work with the family to encourage children to participate in physical activities and to ensure that children are getting healthy food. Also, further researches are needed from all responsible organizations to identify causes and more solutions for childhood obesity. This will help to reduce the incidence of children obesity among children and will prevent its dangerous effects in the future.

29793,cp5,4049,"     As we are concerned about our health, we are also concerned about the doctors who are treating us. Generally, all of the doctors take a significant role in the hospital in different specialties. Medical doctors, Surgeons, Psychiatrists, Dentists and Physical Therapists treat patients either with medications or with surgeries as well as physical rehabilitation. 
In spite of classification of the doctors, there are Orthopedic surgeons, Neuro surgeons and Physical therapists.    
     The first category, orthopedic surgeons are the doctors who are responsible for treating the bone diseases by the surgical procedures. Moreover, there are a lot medical issues that the orthopedic surgeons take care of them. One of them, Osteomalacia, which is a congenital anomaly of the joints articulation, resulted from deficiency of vitamin D. These kinds of patients require vitamin D supplements. Moreover, they need a corrective surgery to the affected joints immediately. Another duty of the orthopedic surgeon is therapeutic surgery for the fractured bones. In fact, this surgery takes a lot of time and it has complex procedures. Because the fractured bones need several weeks or months to get healed and they need bone grafting to join them to each other. Also, the degenerative joints disease is another bone disease which is developed by aging, are treated by the orthopedic surgeons. For example, knee and hip osteoarthritis. The main surgical treatment is the artificial joints which take place the degenerated joints.
      The second category is the neuro surgeons. These surgeons are the doctors who are responsible for treating the neurological diseases. These diseases might result from external harm to the human body, neuromuscular diseases or disc prolapsed diseases. External harm to the body, like traffic accidents lead to traumatic brain injury and fracture of the skull bones. This case requires complex surgical procedures to the brain that are done by the neuro surgeon. More dangerous than that are the inherited neuromuscular diseases like multiple sclerosis, which leads to complete paralysis of the body. In this critical disease, the neuro surgeon will treat the symptoms such as sensation loss by injection antibiotics in the nerves to enhance their functions. Another kind of the neurological diseases is that resulted from compression on the nerve roots by the disc. For example, Sciatica in the back and Spondylosis in the neck need an urgent decompressive surgery to eliminate the compression on the nerve roots.
     The third category is the Physical Therapists. In comparison to the surgeon, the physical therapist's job is entirely different because he does not use any surgical intervention. Furthermore, he treats his patients by physical procedures such as the application of hot or cold packs and by physical exercises. Medically, physical therapy starts when a patient has orthopedic or neuro surgery which is known as post-surgical physical rehabilitation. For instance, the patient who had a surgery for the fractured bone or joint needs stretching and strengthening exercises to strength and facilitate a normal range of motion to the affected limb. Also, these exercises are necessary for the weak muscles and the stiff joints. Regarding the neurological diseases, the physical therapist helps the patient to maintain his activities of daily living by strengthening and balance exercises. 
     In conclusion, all of the doctors have their relevant specialties in all medical areas. No matter what are their specialties, they should coordinate their treatment medically, surgically and physically. As a result of this coordinated and harmonized working, the patient will get the most comprehensive and maximum benefit of treatment.

When I started the engine for my car in Miami, I saw wrong time on the clock of my car. Although my intuition told me I needed to have the battery in my car replaced, but I kept driving without changing it, I ignored it. Before my travel, I had just asked a car shop assistant near my house to check the battery. He said that the battery condition was fine. Thus, I just believed what he said without my checking. After I had stopped a fast food restaurant in Key Largo, located between Miami and Key West, I started the engine again. However, the engine did not work. I did not comprehend what happened to my car because I thought that the battery was fine and the gas was almost full. I called a road service to fix my car. I had to wait a long time for the road assistant. After the road service assistant checked my car, he told me that the duration of the battery life was finished. Because the road service assistant had replaced the battery with temporary one, I managed to arrive at the hotel that I booked in Key West. However, it was mid night, so all restaurants and café were closed. I could not enjoy having a great dinner, and I just stayed at the hotel. If I had replaced the battery before I left Miami, I might have prevented the engine from not working.

Among the world .we have many different types of military service system. In my country, there is flexible military service which means men can have options to go to army. While in some other countries such as Korean, Turkey and Switzerland ,they require all men to enter the military when they reach the age of 18.This different has various reasons. But people have different opinions about this service: some are for while some are against it. I also heard that in Korean some famous stars use many methods to skip this service. In China we do not have this mandatory military service. 
The government of every country makes this decision about military service based on many reasons. They may consider their position in the international world and  the international environment . Maybe sometimes they need military to defend themselves. In my opinion I am in favor of this obligation. Some people think that people can make the decision to serve in the military by themselves instead of the government.I will illustrate my opinion in these aspects: the benefits of country, the importance of protect people and the importance for individuals. I will explain more details about these three aspects in the following passage.

On the one hand, some people may think that there are many pressures from being a student. On the other hand, other people might think that there are no pressures from being a student if comparing with bussiness working or responsibilities. However, in my final judgment, I have developed my own point of view as well. I consider that pressures of being a student are including three resources, including tuition, eximinations and assignments, and study goals. Below is my discussing.
         First of all, the first reason that can be presented to develop my position is tuition, especially studing in a foreign country. During studying abroad, I have to afford the tuition as well as textbook costs. On the other hand, if I continued my job, I would accumulate more wealth. I choose to study abroad and be a student, so, I also take charge of all economics pressures. I think there is no better fact than this one to illustrate my view.
        In addition, another opinion of students' pressure is examinations and assignments. For example, some students would take TOEFL or a GRE tests for applying a graduate school. Besides, at the same time, they also need to complete homeworks that a teacher assigns students to finish. If you can understand this case, you can see my point more clearly.
        Last but not least, not only are tuition, and examinations and assignments mentioned, but study goals also should be taken into accounted. To illustrate, the purpose why I study in foreign area is as the same as one of my studying goals, improving language abilities and pursuing professional knowledge.  I have a pressure for reaching this aim. These grounds deeply support my point of view on this issue.
        In conclusion, if all reasons and examples mentioned above are considered, in my opinion, studying fee, homeworks and examinations, and studying aims are absolutely these pressures for being a student. Of course, there is also an argument to be made for the opposing position. Nevertheless, for these reasons that I have presented above, I believe that the great study comes from the great pressure.

The FARC, revolutionary armed forces of Colombia in Spanish, are a guerrilla movement that was created in the 1960 in Colombia.  Initially, their  purpose  was to install a communist regime in Colombia but their goal changed with time and they started to cultivate cocaine and drugs in different areas, using this  ""industry"" to finance their organization and purchase weapons. With time the drug business was more and more lucrative for them, consequently they grew in more areas of Colombia. The guerilla is a significant problem to Colombians and it is the cause for many sad problems in my country such as violence, kidnapping, and drugs. 


First of all, the FARC is the main generator of violence in Colombia. They used to kill or force innocent people in rural areas to leave their farms and use this territory to grow cocaine plants.  When the people were forced to leave their homes in rural areas, it was usually people that had owned the land for many years.  This people, who initially had a normal lifestyle,   using the farms to cultivate fruits or vegetables, were forced into poverty.  The guerilla used to arrive to the farms suddenly with weapons and force the people to leave their place many times only with what they had on.   This people would lose everything, including their opportunities and they would have no other choice than to leave the towns and migrate to a bigger city without money or home, without nothing!. If the people didn't want to leave their territory the Guerilla would intimidate and even kill some people and in some cases violate the woman and occasionally they killed entire families!  They also did terrorist attacks in some cities and towns, consequently they injured people, soldiers, children, and infrastructure.


The guerilla also started to kidnap for financing.  The would initially ask money to people with resources, so they would have to pay significant ransoms and if they denied to pay the guerilla kidnapped one member of the family.  It didn't matter  if  they were children, old, or sick people. The guerilla took the people to the jungle, without healthcare or food, without a place to live and they would treat this people very poorly until the family paid the money. Some families went into  bankruptcy because they were asked to pay big amounts of money. Then the guerilla stared to kidnap politics, they said that they would do a humanitarian interchange but this has also been a lie. Fortunately all the violence and kidnapping has changed in the past 8 years with the current president who has changed many of this by making the government reach all this areas and make the guerrillas go deep into the jungle. 


With respect to the drugs, they cultivate cocaine in the jungle and they use that to obtain money.  As a result they buy more weapons to kill innocent people, kidnap and do violent things. They export the drugs to Europe and the United States and this money also contributes greatly to the violence, and our government has worked very hard to extinguish the cocaine plantations and many good people have died trying to stop this. Obviously they obtain big money with this business, and they still take farms of innocent people and they become more rich, and the poor people become more poor. For me and for all Colombians this doesn't make any sense. 


There are various consequences of the FARC presence in my country. With our current president, Alvaro Uribe all of this has been improving, and now we can travel in my country without fear, and the number of displaced people is decreasing, and the terrorist attacks have decreased. On the other hand, the guerilla has gone to many other countries to explain their politics, and some people even believe in them! But the foreign people don't know how many tears have been shed by the acts of the guerilla in Colombia.   It is a sad story, because my country is very beautiful, and full of many good people, smart and good workers. So if one day you hear about Colombia and bad news, don't think that all people are drug dealers, or bad people, the good people are many more.  Everyone who goes to Colombia always wants to stay or come back, because people are very friendly, and my country is the most beautiful, lovely and best country in the world.

7158,cc4,1166,"     Throughout Korea history, most people thought that only women have to do housework. Do you think that only women have to do housework? Now, most women are participating in social working, and they also have changed awareness of the role of women. For example, Bo-Young Lee is a famous English writer, lecturer and Ji-Yeon Baek is a famous professor, an announcer. Although there used to be discrimination between men and women, women have brought new roles about education, employment and housekeeping so far.
     Even if there used to be an educational discrimination between men and women in Korea, women have recovered an educational right. Nowadays, they are attending university and college. The number of women who are participating in the university and college is almost the same with the number of men. According to University of Seoul, which is the best of Korea university, people who attending University of Seoul consist of women more than half. Actually, women are becoming better than men about grade of school. In Korea, There is no difference between men and women in terms of education.
     In Korea, The rate of women's employment is becoming equal to men. The women who have occupation are also increasing. Once, women could not get a job such a doctor or lawyer, etc, whereas they can get these jobs recently. For example, Kyung-Suk Jung is famous for a woman doctor about pregnancy. And the woman lawyer Mi-Ae Kim is working as lawyer that solves problems relating to social problem. This facts show us that the occupations such as a doctor and lawyer are not just for men. Capable women are needed in various fields of the society.
     As more and more women have occupation lately, both men and women have done housework unlike the past. That is, housework is a joint work. Once, women had done family affairs like doing the laundry, cleaning the room. Nowadays, however, husband and wife do housework together, and they earn money from their job as well. They can get a lot of money, as well as finish housework quickly.
     Despite discrimination between men and women in the past, women have recovered a right in Korea. In summary, women have contributed in many areas of society. We should not have prejudice that women have to do housework. We also should think that women and men are equal. In the future, more women will take part many fields of society.

2822,fx9,342,"        She is an introvert person, but she is not shy at least. She usually works effectively and shows her best strength when she works on something alone. For example, she gets a good score on a test if she studies herself. On the contrary, if she studies with her friends, she starts to mind about them and cannot keep her pace and concentrate her study at all. At last, she gets a bad score on a test. She likes to be and talk with people, but she cannot completely demonstrate her abilities when she is with others. After she is or talks with others for a while, she starts to feel a bit tired and think about something else. Although an extrovert person may work effectively and show his or her capabilities when he or she works with others, in terms of this point, she is not extravert at all. Also, she is quite a practical and logical person. To illustrate this personality, let me give you a good example. Every time she saw her parents arguing, she just tried to stop it because she objectively judged it based on her experience. This means she thought that what was happening was an argument, it was a bad event and it had to be stopped. She did not try to see the relationship between her parents, so she did not realize for many years that her parents actually enjoyed arguing. If she had been a more intuitive person and had more insight to judge what is really happening or what the real meaning of what she sees, she would have been able to notice the meaning of her parents' argument and not have stopped it. She wishes she could take more intuitional actions. In addition, she feels comfortable with organized circumstances. If things are settled, and situations are predictable, she feels at ease. For instance, when she takes a trip without any hotel reservations, she cannot go anywhere or enjoy the trip because she will be always concerned about where to stay. As another example, when she has her flight or train cancelled, the sudden event makes her get flustered. She does not know what to do immediately. She is in a panic, so it takes quite some time for her to settle down and start to think about and take a next step. She likes to have set plans. No hotel reservations seem to mean a lot of options about her stay. Although it is good to keep her options open, a flexible circumstance gives her uncomfortableness and uneasiness. She sometimes thinks she wants to make decisions more freely based on her personal values and do or say something different she really wants to. However, she cannot do that unless she has more free and flexible mind, so she sometimes feels frustrated and restrained and also feels like she always tracks the course. She thinks she wants to break and jump out of her rigid standards for judgment. I hope she can. Who do you think she is?

29141,gj2,4010,"                                 The Effects of Poverty


     Poverty is the most challenging problem all over the world due to the complexity of the underlying causes. According to The Washington Times (Weber, 2009, para 1), 2.8 million Americans were below the poverty line in 2008.  Governments are unable to eradicate poverty or to amend people's lifestyle. Therefore, economists and experts have tried to find the causes and eradicate them. As we all know, an inadequate income and unsatisfactory wage can lead to more serious consequences such as an uneducated society, increasing crime and disease. 
     All in all, impoverished parents are unable to pay the tuition of their children, which increases illiteracy in poor countries. Low income forces children to stop going to schools even though they are free, owing to the school's requirements. According to Global Issues Organization (Shah, A. ,2009), 121 million children are out of education worldwide. In addition, poor countries usually don't offer school for public because of lacking money. Therefore, it increases the children who cannot read or write even their names.  
     The second effect of poverty is an increasing crime rate more than normal range. Everyone struggles to be survive leading him to make any effort to get money or food to protect him from death. Furthermore, hunger obliges people to do illegal things without thinking ahead of the consequences.  What do you expect from people who live in poor countries, lacking security and the continuing wars?
     Last but not least, disease spreading is a reflection of poverty. The rate of public health in Europe and America is higher than is in Sub- Saharan Africa. Also, the most shocking fact that 2.2 million children die each year because they are not immunized, according to Global Issues Organization (Shah,A. 2009). AIDS and serious disease are increasing in poor countries and mortality is high.
     In conclusion, the effects of poverty are an uneducated society, increasing crime and disease. It is possible to eliminate poverty from the world by our aid. Why do we ignore struggling communities? Do they deserve what they are suffering from? Why do wealthy nations turn their faces away from them? These questions and others are asked every day but no response. I thank everyone who contributes to poor aid and does his best to lessen poverty and help people to live in peace and prosperity.

31610,da9,4294,"                              Happiness

      While some people are happy, it coincides that some people are sad; however, everybody can reach their happiness in different ways. Happiness is a state of being happy, and when you reach it, you feel excited and sometimes you laugh by yourself. There are several causes of happiness for me; however, these are the three most important causes of my happiness: being healthy, being with my family and friends, and having money to feed my family.
      The first most important cause of my happiness is being healthy. Being healthy is an important cause of my happiness because even if i have everything in this world, and i am not happy, it doesn't mean anything if i am not well. Sickness is something that nobody wishes to have because it makes us suffer and takes away the taste of life. Consequently, being healthy is the most important element of my happiness.
      The second most important cause of my happiness is being with my family and friends. Having my family and friends on my side is also an important cause of my happiness. For example, whenever i am having a hard moment such as being sick or having personal problem, they are here to cheer me up or to sustain me no matter what i do or what i have. Interacting with them and having their advice makes me happy. Therefore, having these people with me is an integral part of my happiness. 
      The third most important cause of my happiness is having money to feed my family. Money is not a major cause of my happiness but it completes it. Having enough money to feed my family and be able to pay for my education and for my children makes me happy. Moreover, even if education is the key of the world, but not to always depend on your parents support. Thus, having enough money to take care of my family completes my happiness.
      In conclusion, being healthy, being with my family and friends, and having some money to feed my family are the most significant causes of my happiness. Even if, i don't have enough money to handle all of that stuff, having the two others makes really me happy.",Male,French,Write a five-paragraph essay about the causes of happiness

As we all know the most major part of a bank's revenue is acquired from a loan business. Spending future money for enjoying present entertainment is a contemporary consumer culture  all over the world. Mortgage is built on the foundation of ancient pawnbroking.  The modern technology of mortgage classify the function of the pawnbroking . Before my graduating from a university ,I was not certain about my career path .However, after I worked in 3 banks within 4 years and a half, I have already known what field I want to work in . My professional plan of a career is become a mortgage manager. I 'm proud of my operational skills and the well known knowledge of an economic policy (such as exchange rate) and I am confident of my interpersonal skills and problem-solving. I wish I will have a high limited authority of handling a mortgage case in the future.  
The most important skill needed to succeed in becoming a mortgage manager is the ability of 
the interpersonal skills. It's so much fun to express myself wherever I go .One of the wonderful things about communicating with someone is to convey my  happiness and sincerity  . Make  new friends at a party and keep in touch with real estate companies so that I can get more information about my potential customers .Moreover, I like spending time on getting to know existing clients and I have to know as much as possible about client's need so that I could expand my business. I think cultivating a real dialogue might solidify the relationship with a client .

The second important skill is the background of my work experience and professional  knowledge. For an instance, I had passed the exam of anti-fake currency issued by China Central Bank . Eventually, I got the qualification certificate for anti-fake currency without doubt. Furthermore, every case could be handled by me within excellent high-speed . Meanwhile, I do not think an officer who works in an operational department and does an ordinary work looks like a robot. This is a basic work for every new colleague to start their careers. Fully master the whole operational work flow/line helps me understand economic policy .It could helps me to set an professional appearance in front of my clients as well.

The last but not least, the ability of problem - solving can be improved by social experience. You never know what you can do till you try . I never say no to my friends when we have different opinions but I try to talk them into understanding my opinion. And I never say no to my boss, because the decision can not be drawn by me. Therefore, I would say "" boss, I fully agreed with you plan ,we will achieve a great goal according to your perspective. If you can support us something ( eg : IT systerm ),we will do it better""  On the other hand , the skill of problem - solving  can helps me reduce trouble and increase sales opportunity . 

In summary , the most essential ability for a mortgage manager consists of   interpersonal skill , background of education and problem - solving . Fire is the test of gold. I just need an opportunity, and I 'm waiting for that day.

      Many schools are mandating and enforcing school uniforms for their students. School uniforms become a new argument in the most schools around the world.  Students have to accept them or not depend on which school they are. I think students should wear school uniforms instead of the ordinary clothes.
   
    Despite this argument for schools, some people might argue that the students should not wear school uniforms. They have many reasons to prove that. First, students have their rights to wear anything they want. To force them to wear uniforms in schools are a violation of their students' rights. Also, the livable degree between the students is different. If the sponsor cannot afford uniforms for their children, they won't be able to go to school. So, the sponsor has to spend much money in clothes instead of food or necessary things they need. In addition, students especially teens need to assert their personality. With the opportunity to wear anything, the sponsor and the administration can know more about the student's desire. Finally, these people against the school uniforms and they have their own reasons to believe that.


     On the other hand, many people and I agree with mandatory of the school uniforms. They also have their reasons. First, There is no discrimination between the students. School uniforms build a sense of unity in schools. All students have the same clothes so; it would be easy to identify them in any place. For example, if they are kidnapped, it will be easier to describe the students to the police to recognize them. In addition, school uniforms make the violence less preventable by eliminating one major warning sign. For example, the uniforms control the gang in the schools and reduce their power on the rip students. Due to impose school uniforms, the sponsor   doesn't have to think about new clothes for their children. For example, the sponsor can offer tow or three uniforms to their children at the whole semester so, no need to spend money every month.

     In conclusion, today school uniforms still make argument to accept them or not. I think the administrators in schools have to implement policies to achieve the environmental organized school by unifying the school uniforms.

Earthquakes have two negative effects, loss of life and economic problems. 
Earthquakes cause buildings to collapse. When these buildings collapse, the people inside of them are injured or killed.  People lose their parents and siblings. After they lose their parents and siblings they will have no one to support them or guide them. 
The loss of buildings also has negative effects on the economy. After an earthquake, people lose their stores and places where they worst they are forced to relocate to other areas while their stores are rebuilt. If they relocate to a bad location, they will lose business.
 In conclusion, people must focus their efforts on earthquake prevention because it will minimize the loss of life and infrastructures.

25737,gb4,3447,"How people's childhood experiences influence their lives

In this world, every individual is unique. All people have their own personalities, outlook on life and values. In a certain meaning,  all these are influenced by their different experiences and surrounding environments of childhood, such as families, school lives and social experiences.

First of all, family is the most effective factor to child's growth. Their parents are  not only the parents but also the first teacher. What kind of good habits should children be able to get into depend on the family education from their parents. If the parents are  traditional, conservative on educating their children,  the children will get the basic manners easily and will get to learn how  behave themselves better. This is very important thing for people's growth. 
Here is an example that about an American actor whose name is Wentworth Miller was interviewed as a guest in some talk show of Fenghuang TV(Chinese TV department), he talked about his childhood, especially about his parents who were keeping a strict hand over him. He owes his ability in success to his parents. So it's obviously to see that the family is how constructive to child's growth. 

In addition, when children start  to study in school, the school life will become a main part in their student's lives. The activities of school are not only for learning knowlege in classes, but also for making friends and getting used to staying the social life of the school. These things are really rich and colorful for children to make experiences.  Sometimes , the teachers are also required fair treatment to offer opportunities for each student . Some of children are  shy, so  if the teacher doesn't  encourage them to join the group activities, they probably would be isolated from others. Of course this is not just that teachers have to take the responsibility for children, parents are also must cooperate with teachers in educating their children. Usually people who graduated from schools have their good or bad memories which affect them make the next or future decisions , such as deciding  to become a good teacher like their respected and beloved teachers. Therefor, school life is a very important  element for influencing  people's life.

Finally , people, even children can not live without any social work , that means people always make the social experiences though living  in reality and nature. For example, children like  to spend holidays with families or friends, they could enjoy any small thing in naive way. By playing games with friends or doing activities with families, they will build cognition to this world, in other words, a sense of justice, a sense of commitment to society, a view of natural science. According to a research report, most Americans who attended religious services at some point during childhood look back on their experience in a positive way.   66%percent believe their religious attendance before age 18 gave them a good moral foundation. ( Most adults who attended religious services as a child are glad they did, Ellison Research, ANON_URLPAGE) On the other hand, if children dislike to join those kinds of activities, they maybe will lose some ability to live well with others.

In conclusion, whatever people recognize the importance about how their childhood experiences influence their lives. Though , people live in different countries with different customs, in fact, those experiences have been exactly affecting their lives so far, even the future.

     Although they are similar in protecting my hands from dry. There are many differences between Crabtree and L'OCCITANE. First, they have different sizes and prices. The smallest size in Crabtree is 1.7 fl oz. costs $7.00 and in L'OCCITANE is 1 fl oz. costs $9.00. The content in L'OCCITANE is lesser than it in Crabtree, but the price in L'OCCITANE is more expensive than Crabtree. The large size in Crabtree is 3.4 fl oz. costs $14.00 and in L'OCCITANE is 5.2 fl oz. costs $25.00. The content in L'OCCITANE is bigger than it in Crabtree, and the price in L'OCCITANE is still more expensive than Crabtree. If I want to use hand cream for a long time, I should buy L'OCCITANE. However, I think that L'OCCITANE is too expensive for me to buy it. In addition, L'OCCITANE hand cream blended with alluring aromas of jasmine and ylang-ylang essences, and Crabtree hand cream blended with rose water. Hence, the flavors in L'OCCITANE are richer than those in Crabtree. However, the flavor in Crabtree smells better than L'OCCITANE.

It seems that there is not any difference between men and women in many societies.  However, some pars of the world, many parents still prefer to have male children rather than female children.  They even abort when they knew that the baby in their womb is female.  Consequently, the proportion of men is higher than that of women in those societies.   Parents in some part of the world prefer boys because of carrying on a family line, physical reason, and biased social recognition of women. 
              First of all, the fact that boys carry on a family line when they grow up makes parents prefer boys.  One of the basic desires of humans is keeping their family by producing offspring.   In many countries, women follow their husband's last name when they get married.  Also, married women are considered a member of their husband's family.   Therefore, parents want to have a son who will continue their family. 
         The second reason is that men are physically stronger than women.  Especially, tendency of preference of boy is strong in agricultural societies because people need a physically strong person as a worker.  In agricultural societies, strength is connected directly to productivity.  
            Finally, parents prefer boys because of the biased social recognition of women.

8972,eq8,1414,"Every county has a representive food. For example, Saudi Arabia has Kap-sa, Japan has Su-shi, America has burgers or hot dogs. My country, Korea, has Kim-chi. Korean people always love to eat Kim-chi, with their meals. Today, I'm going to introduce ""how to make Kim-chi"". Before making Kim-chi the gathering of friendly people is important. Because we only make it a couple of times a year, we have to make a lot of Kim-chi at once. Thus people spend a lot of times making Kim-chi. This time is spent not only making Kim-chi but also deepening friendship. It is easy to make Kim-chi if you follow these three steps.
 First of all, make a decision on what kind of Kim-chi. Kim-chi has much different kind of types. To choose each different Kim-chi, it needs different ingredient. Kim-chi has three types in common. If there is one thing we have enough of, it is cabbage Kim-chi. Regardless of area in Korea, we can find easily everywhere with Korean meals. If you see Kim-chi advertisement, it is almost cabbage Kim-chi which contains red pepper. Second, we have water Kim-chi. It is not contains red pepper and can see north areas in Korea. It is easy to distinguish other Kim-chi because it looks white and has soup. Sometimes, we eat water Kim-chi when someone shocked. Third, we have scallions Kim-chi. It is different from cabbage Kim-chi. It is mainly based on scallions, not cabbage. It is common in south areas in Korea. Otherwise, depend on different types Kim-chi; they have different recipes each other. I want to introduce about cabbage Kim-chi.
 After make a decision on what kind of Kim-chi, you gather the ingredients. Before gathering ingredients, you decide that how much Kim-chi to make because Kim-chi is fermentation food. If you make too much, it is easy to make sour. Then you choose fresh vegetable. Cabbage Kim-chi needs the ingredients, such as cabbages, radishes, scallions, garlic, ginger, onions, powdered red pepper, pickled baby shrimp, oysters, salt and sugar. If you do that, you are ready.
 Before make a Kim-chi, you should go though due exactly formalities. If not, it makes different taste. After you gathered all the ingredients put the cabbage sections in salt water for 10 hours, drawing out the water. The next thing you do is slice the radishes and add 2 cups of warm water to the red pepper powder. It is mixed well when the red color is set. Then you should add the scallions, garlic, and ginger and mix well. Combine all the ingredients with pickled baby shrimp, add the radishes and mix well. Then, pack the ingredients in the cabbage leaves. Finally cover the top with some of the trimmed green outer leaves of cabbage and spread salt over it.  Let it sit for some time until completely fermented. 
 In conclusion, whenever I miss Kim-chi, I buy Kim-chi. However, I can't feel flavor which my mother's Kim-chi. No one make my mother's Kim-chi because my mother put the whole mind to Kim-chi for her son. That is; it is easy to make Kim-chi if you follow these steps but most important is Kim-chi has to contain mother's devotion. Kim-chi has a lot of spicy so you eat first time it is hard to eat Kim-chi. However, if you become accustomed, you will like it.

12781,cb8,1929,"Types Living Options for Students 

All students should live in clam place. That is very important for them because they can spend a lot of time for studying.  The student should choose the best place. It is the student is a person who decides what the place is superior for him/her. There are three types of living options for students: with their family, with a roommate, or alone.  
                
        While students are living with their families, they are always getting an easy life. Their families clean, cook, and wash for them, so the students have a lot of time.  If students have a lot of time, they can study more and more and also the student has times for relaxing.  Often the families  spend and pay for the students, so the students do not take care of money and do not need a part time job.  That is, students do not have  problems with money because they do not have a lot of money.  .  The families are always looking and trying to find an easy life for student because they try to improve their life and take care of the students. So, that gives the student an amazing time.   The student who lives with his/her family, he/she gets a trouble-free time.

The student lives who with a roommate, the student needs to adept his/her self.  When the student starts to live with a roommate, the student has a different life. Therefore, the student needs to do what he/she needs in his/ her life and a life requirement.  For example, the student cleans house, washes clothes, and cooks food.   The student has a part time job because the student needs some money.  That is because the student does not have a lot of time for studying.  The student who lives with a roommate the student spends a lot of money on rent, food, and books.   If the student lives with a roommate, the student should organize times.
        
If the student lives alone, that it is very difficult. The student spends a lot of money because the student does not share expenses with someone. When the student buys what he/she needs, such as food, rent, internet, cable TV, and electricity. When the student has any problem in his/her apartment or his/ her life, the student does not have anyone to help him/her.  For example, if the student is sick, and no one knows, that is not healthy for him/her.  The student should take care of him/her self because that is no one else knows about it.  However, while the student is living alone, the student has a lot time for studying. So, for the student to live alone sometimes is good and sometimes is bad.

        I think students should think about what it is excellent for him/her. That is very important because the student is a person whose can decide for him/her self. For example, I used to live with my family, a roommate, alone. The best place was when I lived with my family. They took care for me, gave me advice, spent a lot of money, shared  life with someone who I loved him and the love me, and I had a lot of time for my studying.  So, students should think about it, and choose what is superior for him/her.

28217,es0,3922,"  For the past decades, students had to use the mass producted media such as books, video tapes. There were not various methods which were effective for students. In this situation, televisions were innovative ways for students to get some information; however, nowadays, it seems that the Internet substitutes for the mass media almost completely. I think, the prevalence of the Internet is an educational innovation, especially for students. The explosion of the Internet has had three important effects on the students; the access to the materials, convenience and interaction through the Internet.
 First, the most distinct effect is the access to the information. Because the Internet line is installed almost every building, students can take advantage of the educational materials through the Internet. In other words, students get unqualified access to the Internet, if they can manipulate the computer. We can call this phenomenon as 'ubiqitous', which means everywhere. Recently, students who don't use the Internet can't keep up with other students who use the Internet because the speed of searching Internet based materials is faster than existing methods of searching mass media.
 Another noticeable effect is the convenience. Nowadays, students don't have to carry a heavy bag which is stuffed with many books. On the Internet, there are so many visual media and texts suitable for each student. If students had the storing tools lke as USB, compact disk, they could download useful information from the Internet. Because of this reason, the more the Internet is improved, the more students will be comfortable.
 A third significant effect is the interaction. We can describe this system by giving a simple example; some students can post his problem on the Internet and other students discuss how to solve the problem. By exchanging beneficial ideas with one another, students can get advanced performence in their work. In this point, we can say the Internet is an invisible forum for students.
 In conclusion, to develop the Internet technology is very important since it give students a lot of advantage. In addition, making an adequate choice from a lot of information based on the Internet is also a significant task of the students. If students didn't have the skill to get useful information, students couldn't enjoy the comfort of the Internet.

My ex-roommate received many foods which were fully filled in a bag from his friend who just arrived from Spain. Chorizo is a fermented cured sausage made by pork in Spain. It is usually cut in slice and eaten without cooking. The Chorizo I ate was already sliced and I put a few slices of Chorizo on a piece of bread. After putting Chorizo, I folded by half and tasted with curiosity. The taste of the food was absolutely exotic but pretty good. Specifically, the taste was a little bit salty and the Chorizo was a little tough. I think, due to the toughness, slicing is preferred for Chorizo. However, it was mostly sweet and moderately hot. At that time, I couldn't imagined that Chorizo is made by pork. I said yummy to my friend and he said that the Chorizo we ate was his favorite among Chorizos in Spain. Since then, Chorizo has become one of my favorite food. In addition, Chorizo is one of the reasons which made me go to Spain later.

39186,as2,5249,"        Nowadays, obesity is increasingly becoming a major problem in all over the world even in developing countries. Obesity means a physical condition that a person has heavy weight and too much fat on the person's body, which severely affects human health such as diabetes or heart attack. There are three main causes, which are unhealthy eating habit, less exercise and stress.
        According to a research, the most commonly eaten vegetable among children is potato in the U.S. It indicates that most children intake carbohydrate, which will work as sugar in their body, from vegetable instead of fiber or vitamin, which contributes their health. This unhealthy eating habit is related to their parents whose knowledge of nutrition is not enough. Less knowledge of nutrition causes unhealthy eating habit and eventually it causes obesity.
        In addition, another reason of obesity is that people tend to not exercise. Consuming energy, which they had, is an important factor to keep their body healthy; however, the more our lifestyle become modern, the less exercise. People always use transportation such as cars or buses instead of walking. It necessarily reduces opportunities to digest calorie, which avoid being obesity.
        Finally, the most invisible reason is stress. If people constantly expose strong stress, they would get uncontrollable appetite. Furthermore, appearance of fat itself might be stress for fat people. This vicious circle makes difficulty to overcome obesity.
        In conclusion, it is unlikely to cause obesity only one cause. In other word, unhealthy eating habit, less exercise and stress, obesity is caused by these three complex causes.

34696,ae9,4731,"                             Global warming

    Global warming has become a serious problem for a long period of time. Global warming means the atmosphere's temperature is increase with a very rapid rate that is much faster than before. Also means that the greenhouse effect is more obvious than it was in the past. Scientists all over the world are engage in solving this problem. But they still not come up with a good solution about how to settle this environmental problem.

    The overuse of fossil fuel is the mainly cause of global warming. Since the 1800s, the Industrial Revolution has made the mineral oil become the most important resource in generating electricity and other power for our daily life. However, burning fossil fuel will produce a kind of gas; named carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the major element that make the atmosphere can't release its heat from sun.

    The effects of global warming may affect our life in many different kinds of aspects. First, in the recent one hundred years, the weather has become more extremely in temperature. That's mean the summer get hotter and the winter get colder. As the global warming become more serious, the summer and winter may be more unbearable. For example, India has twenty three people died last summer because of the heat is too high (almost 112 in Fahrenheit), this number is the largest ever.
Secondly, the increase heat of atmosphere will also melt the ice in the two poles area. This phenomenon will make the sea level rise, and country that is at low sea level may cover by water and disappear. Holland and Bengal are two countries that are facing this serious problem recently.
Thirdly, the temperature's change will also affect the growing of crops. Lot of countries may be force to face the food shortage, because they can no longer plant anything, such as Africa and South Asia.
Moreover, changes of atmosphere have influence people's health in some biological and chemical reasons. For example, the number of people that have skin cancer increase every year. The reason is because without the protection of some elements in the atmosphere, such as Ozone (O3), the skins will exposure directly under the sunshine, and makes the gene of skin mutate. This is one of the likely reasons that cause skin cancer we know today.

    Although the solution of stopping global warming is not found yet, we can do something that won't make the situation worse. Scientists are trying to find some ways to decrease the use of fossil fuel. Developing green power is a popular subject nowadays. We use wind, water, terrestrial heat and so on to generate power instead of using mineral oil. There is a new technique that using both oil and electric in the Automobile. For scientists found out that cars produce more carbon dioxide when they move at very low speed, such as in a traffic jam or driving in city, they invented  cars that use electric when they is driven at low speed. In this way, cars can reduce the carbon dioxide effectively when driving.

    Not only scientists, we can also help improve the environment in several ways. 
One way is to save electric. Turning off water and light when we don't use are basic things that we should have done to save our energy. Besides, we should walk by stairs if the storey is not so much, instead of taking the elevators. 
The other way is to avoid making too much carbon dioxide. Taking bus or other public transits instead of driving is an easy thing to do, and it really helps a lot. 

    Global warming needs everyone's effort and it is our responsibility to enhance our environment. All of us should do our best to make the earth a better place to live.

The most three important things of my life are family life, friends' relationship and career. I grew up in a lovely family. All of the members of my family are humble and honest.  My parents are conceded our family education more than school grade. Thus keeping well relationship between us is one of the most significant issues of my family even though we do not live together.  As I know many siblings of a family have a big competition to each other, but among our siblings, we don't have any competition during our school education. In other hand, each of our siblings is as a back up to each one. So if someone gets trouble, others would do they best to help to him/ her. For example I am here, U.S.A. and applying schools. When I need a lot of something I always ask my sibling to help me to look for me, they always put them in the first priority. Moreover, I have had a lot of friends who helped me during my life. I think without their help, I could not do as much as I can and have a pleasant school life and enjoyable worked experiences. For instance, when first day I came here, I felt a little anxious to be here. My friend who picked me up at airport gave me a lot of suggestions how to live here. Now I can survive here. Thus the friendship is very important thing for me in my life. Furthermore, a successful career is indispensable to my life. It is not only for making a lot of money but also something to contribute your family, society and community. So that is why I am continuing to learn and update my knowledge of my filed. I wish one day I can be a successful person in my career. To sum up, everyone has his own important thing in one's life. For me the family life, friends' relationship and career are most important things in my life without of them I may feel my life is empty.

30086,ha2,4185,"       People get a vacation at least once a year and they want to enjoy it. The vacation is a special sweet reward to refresh people from their study or work and it gives you an unforgettable memory and a valuable experience. Therefore, people want their vacation to be well organized and planned. There are several steps to plan a vacation successfully. 
       First, make a list of places where you want to go by searching information. Usually, you can get a lot of information through internet. There are web sites of travel agencies, on line travel clubs and photos and information posted by real people who want to share their experience in their blogs. They will tell you about the price, distance and attractions. Collect all of them and make a list for your choice. 
      Second, decide the place and period by comparing and analyzing the places that you wrote down on the list. You should evaluate which place is more appropriate for your vacation. The price, climate or distance should be considered. For example, if you want to go to yellow stone national park, you should check it is available now or not because yellow stone is closed from November to April due to its coldness and snow. Then, make up your mind where you will have a fantastic vacation.
          Third, make a schedule by searching specific information. Creating an itinerary is one of the most crucial processes and exciting parts because you can make your own schedule. Usually, itinerary can be diverse depends on your interests. For example, Florida is a beloved place where people want to visit in their vacation. However, there are several different points of attractions such as Disney world in Orlando, Miami and Keywest. If you are interested in amusement parks, you will stay in Orlando more than in Miami. On the other hand, if you want to enjoy the beach, you will prefer to stay in Miami or Keywest more. Therefore, you should search about your destination thoroughly and select the specific places to go. 
       Forth, start making all necessary reservations. There are several web sites which compare prices, so you can see the whole prices and decide hotels, airplanes and rental cars within your budget. If you reserve them earlier, they are usually cheap.
      Fifth, fill up the suitcase. Pack as many as you will need for the vacation. If you take too many clothes, you will be tired whenever you carry it due to its weight. On the other hand, if you take only a few clothes, you cannot handle the climate change which might happen. Also, don't forget to take a first aid kit, pajamas and hygiene items. However, if you take an airplane for your trip, you cannot bring liquid items more than 100 ml into the plane. Therefore, you have to clarify how many items you will bring and how they will be carried. 
    Finally, ask your trustworthy neighbor or family member to collect your newspaper and mails for safety. If your newspaper and mails are piled much, it indicates obviously that your house is an empty place, which could be attacked by a thief. In addition, if you have a pet such as a dog or a cat, you should find someone who will take your pet because most of hotels and restaurants prohibit pets from entering in.
      In conclusion, planning a vacation requires several steps such as searching about the places where you want go, making an itinerary and reservations, filling up the suitcase and asking somebody to care your home while you are traveling. The well organized and prepared plan for a vacation leads you to a successful vacation by reducing the trial and error and helping you to save your money.

For this reason, many people like travelling but they hate planning for their trips.  It will be more convenient for them if they know these steps.

                    First, you should plan for your budget. You have to know that how much money do you want to spend during your trip because it is easier for you to plan. Besides, it is secured for your money because if you are not budget your expenses, you will spend a lot of money with unimportant stuff. For example, in case you want to buy some souvenirs for your friends and your family and you do not control that some of money, you will use it up because you want to buy many products for them.

For example, you can travel aboard if you have many days for your vacation but in case you do not have enough time, you can plan your trip just for domestic traveling.  In addition, you should find out that what is a good time to travel to those places. For example, if you want to go to Florida State, you should visit it in summer because it is shining. You should not visit there in the raining reason because you have to carry an umbrella with you all the time. Besides, do not forget to check weather for the period that you want to travel. It also can help you to prepare your suitable clothes for your trip if you know a condition of the weather at that period of time.

                     Fifth, you have to buy a plane ticket. You can buy it via many websites such as Orbitz, Expedia and Priceline. You can also get a good deal if those agents have some special promotions at the time you order the ticket. Sometime, you can get a cheaper price if you reserve a plane ticket, a hotel and a car rental from the same agency in advance. Besides, you can get a long stay price if you stay in the same hotel for one or two weeks. You can also use the Internet to find the hotel area that you want to stay.

29597,ar9,4082,"What are the causes of successful iPod

iPod, which is a tiny dangerous one in personal media player (PMP) market, has an impeccable success in ten years. Today iPod is the representation of PMP market; however, ten years ago, Apple Corporation is a declining company which shoulders a lot of financial lost in their Personal Computer (PC) business. The appearance of iPod changes the destiny of this company, the character of easy-carrying replaces the products of Walkman and CD-player and iPod's excellent human-machine interface makes their rival can't compete. In addition, new business model connecting with iTunes store service leads Apple to create the new blue sea in the recording music industry.

 Before the iPod was appear, Walkman was the emperor in the PMP market, however, tape and CD have their inherent disadvantages, and people weren't satisfied with this products. In this period, first generation iPod was announced and made a revolution in the record music market. First, unbelievable storage capacity which you can't image breaks the traditional concepts that people believe. It's more convenient for people to carry more songs. Second, although CD player has more excellent sound quality, but you need to avoid shaking the device and prevent the sound to be interrupted. In addition, beautiful appearance attracts mass. Even though iPod is not a first corporation which develops this product, undoubtedly, it's the most successful one. Comparing Walkman with iPod, the former has more heavy weight, limited capacity, and old fashion appearance. Sony Corporation, which is Walkman's owner company, tried to use Mini Disk (MD) standard to compete with iPod, but Mpeg1 Layer3 Audio (MP3) standard which iPod uses is more popular for people. It's attributed to these factors; iPod created huge profit and occupied the market gradually.

 Actually iPod is not a PMP pioneer in this market. Meanwhile, a lot of rivals were surrounded with iPod. At beginning, they have the same enemy which is a traditional Walkman and CD-player, but what kind causes achieved iPod's success from a lot of enemies? Depending on friendly operate interface. Apple is very different from the other competitions, when they design their product, what they concern about is that how to give users a good using feeling. They never stress how high technology they use or cost down their product's cost as possible as you can. It's like Mac's design principle; they want to break any gap between people and machine. From perspective, Apple lives up to their persistence. For example, iPod shuffle doesn't have complex functions, but it made a new trend that people didn't need to worry what they want to listen. Apple makes their product alive, not only a machines, but also it provides more extra values on their design. Actually I think their design is art and it's captured by people's eye. Jobs is like a magician lead Apple to create lots of fantastic tricks again and again. I thought this unique feature is a very important aspect for iPod's success.

 Indeed, iPod has the most successful first step, but their achievement is not a firework. iTunes takes a very important role in it. Originally I figure that iTunes's target just provides manager software to help people manage their music. They didn't predict that iTunes store has become the music selling platform which people rely on. Based on the huge data resource, people can purchase any songs that they want to provide the reasonable profit for recording industry. It's an unprecedented business model which rescues this declining corporation. Now iTunes's ambition is not only music, including video, movie, and games can be a part of their service. For the other company, what they sell is a product, however, what Apple provides is a service which you want, even they create the atmosphere which affects our trend. iTunes makes a bridge between illegal MP3 and copyright music. After digital music technology is ripe and the music can be spread and remade easily, illegal MP3 issue annoys the recording music industry. Even though iTunes's service can't solve this issue completely, but it's a useful method to enhance this trouble. Anyway, relying on this service, Apple becomes the final winner in this non-sound war.

 iPod's success is not accidental, it experiences three different period in this war, at beginning, iPod's creativity design defeat Walkman and CD player and make a new technology century, and then, the excellent human-machine interface pushes through to the foundation of their products, including iPhone and iPod series. However, I believe Apple understand service is a final solution for their enterprise's growing up, so ITunes focuses on that how to increase more extra values on the iPod and makes the leader position which can't be replaced. All tactics is very gallant and accurate. I amaze that iPod changes our life and admire Jobs' thinking. He is a great pilot for this company and it's a representation man of enterprise.

These rooms reflect the culture and custom of its country. Among the rooms we visited two interesting rooms, the early American room and the Syria-Lebanon room. They have a lot of differences and some similarities. The most obvious difference is these rooms are the decoration. The ceiling, floor, and chairs.

In the early American room we can see that the ceiling of the kitchen-living room ""is of heavy pine beams"" (handout), it is very simple and it is not high, the bed room usually is on top of it. On the other hand, we have a much decorated ceiling in the Syria-Lebanon room. It is high and it is full of colors and carving that reflects the time of that room and how much Arabs love decorating their rooms. 

Both rooms represent wealthy families' houses. The floor in the Syria-Lebanon room is white marble and it has fascinating small pieces of red marbles that are shaped in an Islamic design. Unlike that room the early American room has a wood floor which is not available in all houses, the wood is expensive that's way it was founded in the rich peoples houses.

In addition, scientists have warned us about the greenhouse effect, the gradual warming of the earth because the heat from the sun's rays is prevented from radiating back into space by a blanket of artificial gases.

                                   Left-Handedness


    Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do. About 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks.  Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed, being left-handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right-handed people.
    Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy.  First of all, there are handshakes. Right-handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person.  The instinct of left-handers, however, is to extend their left hand. They have to train themselves to extend their right.  Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table.  Left-handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right-handed person, unless they sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left.  What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass.
    Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school, too.  Consider the chairs in classroom with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers.  Left-handers have to write with their left elbow hanging in midair or else turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk.  Furthermore, when lefties write in a three-ring binder or spiral notebook,  the rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page.  Finally, left-handers write from left to right, so their hand smears the fresh ink across the page.
    Last, but not least are the many inventions of the modern world,  that make life convenient for right-handers but inconvenient for lefties.  These include scissors, can openers, corkscrews, automobile gear shifts, cameras, and computer keyboards.
    In sum, in a world organized for right-handers, left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.

25373,cu8,3475,"         Have you ever thought about how people live without any food and water? The population of the world keeps growing, there are approximately 100 babies are born in every fifteen seconds.  Experts predict that in the 2015, the population will become seven billion people in the world, and in the end of the century, there will be 10 billion people in the world. If the population keeps growing, it will push people into a bad situation which is people don't have enough food and water to feed everyone. How can we solve this problem? The three most commonly proposed solutions are education, people growing more food and control the number of the baby be born.
        The first solution is to educate people about overpopulation. In many countries, the education about overpopulation for people is not enough. There is three different things that people need to learn. Firstly, people should change their perspective which is girls and boys are equal. Many people want to have a boy. If their first baby is a girl, they will try to have another baby until they have a boy. Secondly, people must  to know that  children can not  be free labors. In many poor family, they don't have enough money to hire labors to help them to do the farm work, so they try to have more children to work in their farm for free. Thirdly, people need to learn that money can not buy everything. For many rich people, they think that they have enough money to pay for their children, so they try to have more babies. They do not think that if the world do not have food,  their money will become meaningless.
        Another solution to the overpopulation is growing more food. The problem of overpopulation is do not have enough food, so growing more food is very important for the people. There are two methods to solve this problem. The first method is people have their own garden, so they can grow some food by themselves. The second method is government helps farmer to hire more labors.  It can solve the problem which is farmers need more labors, and it also can solve the problem which is people do not have enough food. 
        The best solution, then, is control the number of the baby be born. The government has to be very serious about this problem. They need to establish the law such as each family can only has two children. If people have more children, they will  get some punishments such as pay many tax. 
       In conclusion, overpopulation is very serious problem in the world, and people have to pay attention on  it. If the overpopulation continue keeps growing, people will go into the dangerous.  Firstly, they have to learn more about overpopulation. Secondly, people need to grow more food. Thirdly, government establishes some law for control the number of the baby be born. If people use these solutions, the overpopulation problem will be better. Now, Are you ready to  help the world solve the overpopulation problem?

11021,co0,1677,"The Causes and Effects of Popularity of the Fast Food Restaurants
The fast food restaurants are became more popular than before. Most people in these days prefer the fast food restaurants and they have a lot of experiences about them. The fast food restaurants begin to be wider in the beginning of the 80 century.  For example, in my home country, Saudi Arabia, there are approximately 2000 fast food restaurants. These restaurants have a lot of co-worker and they usually provide there food quickly as soon as they can. In my opinion, there are two causes for increasing the popularity of the fast food: The people prefer the fast and the mails are very delicious, they knew how to market their foods.
Fist of all, the people prefer to order and eat their males quickly. They don't want to wait for their mails for a long time because the people in these days are very busy and the life is so fast. For example, some times if I have a lot of work and I prefer to have my miles at any fast food restaurants I don't want to lose my time. In addition, the fast food restaurants' are very delicious and they make their foods by using very good flavors.
A second cause is the fast food restaurants have a lot of different way to market their products. For example, they have good advertisements, a beautiful internal design and a lot of restaurant at every street. Also, they have a lot of mails that could match with any one.
On the other, hand even if they are so successful, but they still have some effects on our sociality. for example, there are a lot of studies that say the fast food effect negatively in our bodies and the people who eat the fast food regularly the have a lot of medicine problems such as increasing the whight, increasing the cortisol in the blood.
In conclusion, the popularity of the fast foods can affect on our body and we have to careful and we to be more concise.

Bad habits
Abuse
Infidelity
Smoking tobacco
Alcoholism


KIND OF BAD HABITS


Bad habits engross a large number of items like heavy drinking, swearing, indecency, arguing, overeating, spitefulness, abuse, malice, smoking, cheating, bad smells, etc. More of these bad habits can be normal in different societies, for this reason sometimes are very difficult to explain because someone can be interpreted in different way these concepts. In many cases more of these items can have a relationship between them; for example : A woman who suffer abuse, her husband probably is an alcoholic, use tobacco or any kind of drugs or has another woman. In this article I write about the four items that I think are the most important topics to develop in bad habits comportment like abuse, infidelity, smoking and alcoholism. 

The first topic that I want to develop is abuse. Domestic abuse between spouses or partners is when one person in the relationship tries to control the other person. The victim of domestic abuse or physical abuse can be a man or a woman. The person who produces the abuse can use intimidation, humiliation, mortification, degradation, deprivation or sometimes physical injury. There are a lot of types of abuse like physical abuse, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, financial abuse, spiritual abuse or stalking. Despite of every item is very important, I think the most dangerous abuse is physical abuse because a lot of women die for this reason; for example, in the United States more than three thousand women die per year. Different types of physical abuse are pushing, hitting, beating, kicking, assault with a weapons, burning, etc. I don't know where or when this problem started but one of the hypotheses is what the person who commitment the abuse could be suffered abuse or grew up in a family where existed abuse or sometimes this person doesn't have history about abuse.

The second important topic about bad habits is infidelity or cheating. Lot countries like Colombia, United States or Mexico have an increase in the number of divorce due to infidelity. The number and statistic about this produce scare; for example: 17% of divorces in the United States are caused by infidelity, 22% of married men and 14% of married women have had affairs at least once during their married lives and up to 37% of men and 22% of women admit to have affairs. What it means? Why is the cause of infidelity? Or why you are looking another woman or man if you have everything in your home? These are very difficult questions to answer because if you ask to someone why he or she do this, probably you find a lot of different answers, like I don't know, I have a lot of temptations, I am boring in my relationship; it is the human being nature or only for placer. The infidelity increases day by day and probably we don't have nothing to do to avoid this.

The third but no least important topic is smoking or tobacco use. The purpose of this article is not to write about the effects that the tobacco produce in your health like heart disease, lung disease or how many people die per year for causes of tobacco, it is about the bad habit to smoke. The smoker smells bad, his clothes smells terrible, his teeth change the white color to yellow color. Everybody around the smoker feels that they can smoke too because they are passive smokers inhaling the smoke, at meantime when you go to a close place like a bar your clothes and everything smells like a cigarette. This bad habit is accepted socially because the industries of cigarettes have a lot of power and expend a lot of money in publicity as a result they need to recover this money. I think the anti-smokers laws needs to change to protect everybody who don't smoke 

The last point is alcoholism. This point is very crucial because the alcohol involve much harm; for example, it is very dangerous to the community when someone drive under alcohol influence, he is at risk to suffer an accident or produce an accident, kill people and destroy propriety like his cars, other cars, houses, etc. Other problems are the relation about alcohol, abuse, tobacco and infidelity. Most of the abusers are under influence of alcohol, they can not control themselves and their impulses, and therefore this is a huge trouble for the people around them. They combine alcohol with tobacco or sometimes with other drugs, they change their comportment and start to look someone to commit infidelity and probably finish with an accident or abuse. This is why in this moment around the world are a lot of campaigns against alcohol, to try to reduce accidents, dead, abuse and destruction.

In conclusion, bad habits like abuse, infidelity, smoking tobacco or alcoholism are a great world dilemma and that items need to control as soon as possible to avoid more troubles and create a better place to live for everybody.

28940,at4,4009,"Monsters and ghosts in the United Statas and Japan

 The existence of monsters and ghosts which scare people are found all over the world. For example, these scary monsters are often found in the culture of Halloween in United States when people wear horrible costumes. In Japan, it is very common to talk about ghost stories in summer to cool down sogginess with hair-raising tales. People usually fear evil existence such as ghosts, zombies, vampires and werewolves. At the same time, they could be a one of entertainment seen in the books, TV programs and movies. I am also the one who enjoy these unreal horrors as entertainment. The characteristics these monsters in various regions are similar in a point that they are evil and unfavorable for human being. However, monsters and ghosts often seen in the United States are very different from those of Japanese in the appearance, reason for existence, and behaviors.

 First, the appearances of monsters often seen in the United States are very diverse from those in Japan. Monsters such as a zombie, Frankenstein, a werewolf and a vampire are often seen in the books and films as popular entertainments of the United States. The appearances of these monsters of the United States tend to be very fearful and grotesque which is completely different from ordinary human appearance. For example, zombie wears ragged clothes and has serious injuries on the whole body, and a werewolf almost looks like rugged biped waking wolf. Compared to these monsters in the United States, the scary existences which are often seen in Japanese books and films tend to be ghosts. The typical ghosts, who are called ""Yurei"" in Japan, seem more similar to ordinary human than that of the United States however it is sometimes transparent and/or lacking legs and feet. There are also monsters which are called ""Yokai"" in Japan. Japanese monsters ""Yokai"" have sometimes scary and unique looking as well as the monsters of United States. However some of them have very similar appearance to humans, or sometimes animals such as a raccoon dog or a fox. Therefore, Japanese monsters and ghosts are sometimes drawn more realistically and more related with daily life than the Americans. In addition, Japanese ghosts are difficult to notice from a distance, so the real fear comes up when we became really close to the existence. Also, Japanese ghosts and monsters sometimes never show the physical appearance except their voice in front of people. Consequently, the monsters of the United States are attributed to more visual effects which scare people and unrealistic images, compared to those of Japanese which has subtle, less visual features and more realistic.

 Next, there are also differences of the reason for the existence of monsters and ghosts between Japanese and United States. Japanese ghosts usually have strong souls and they exist because they have sprits. On most traditional stories of ghosts in Japan, reasons for existence of them are usually emotion of grudge and lingering feeling for their life or someone who is living. A story, which a woman who is betrayed by a man and die becomes a ghost and show up in front of the man to revenge, is a very typical ghost story in Japan. This story is related deeply with ideas, such as reincarnation and karma come from Buddhism, which is one of main religions in Japan. ""Concepts of transmutation and transmigration lie at the core of Buddhist theology in Japan (as elsewhere) and it is not surprising that the body would be understood as a temporary lodging place in which a movable spirit resides"". (M.D.Foster p.6, 2009) Also Japanese monsters ""Yokai"" exist to tell people to have appreciation and awe against their life in nature. Compare to Japanese monsters and ghosts, the reason of existence of the evils of the United States tend to be vaguer or drawn as evils itself. For example, definition of a zombie is a dead body without soul. Sometimes, existence of monsters such as a werewolf, Frankenstein and vampires also related to religious aspects in the West. According to P. Day (2006), the concept of vampire is considered as unholy reanimated body came to symbolize dark perversion of a central Christian article of faith. After all, the differences in characters of the monsters are deeply connected to the differences of the religious ideas between Japanese and Americans. 

 Third, the behaviors of monsters in the United States are also very different from those of Japan. The differences of these are reflected well in the horror movies of Japan and the United States. For example, the monsters and evils in the traditional movies in Hollywood are often comes with scary screaming sound or big sound effects which frightened people. On the other hand, the movie which features Japanese ghosts doesn't generate much sound when they appear. The behaviors of Japanese ghosts are unnoticeable and silent so that the fears depend on mental aspects rather than physical ones. In other words, compared to the horror movies related to fear of being attacked by monsters in the United States, the horror movies in Japan have more relation with mental fear of invisible ghosts and natural sounds which are made by water dropping and the footsteps in silence. Japanese have enjoyed and felt already familiar with the stories and movies which feature monsters of the United States for several decades. On the other hand, the concept of Japanese ghosts and monsters seems to emerge in American society recently. Japanese horror movie called ""the Ring"", which was an adaptation from a novel and remaked in the United States was interesting example to demonstrate the typical ways of Japanese horror.
 
 In conclusion, finding the differences of monsters and ghosts between Japanese and American is very interesting. As I wrote in this essay, the differences are come from the diversities of both cultures. Both monsters and ghosts have unique characteristics and are deep rooted with the religions of both cultures. By globalization, these monsters all over the world are sometimes unified or combined in movies and books. Before all, it is true that there is a lot of fun in the stories of monsters and ghosts on both cultures however we fear the existence of them much.I am expecting the monsters and the ghosts which combined both cultures to give us a new style fear in near future.

Today the Internet is an important part of the our life and it is required at school, at home, at work, almost everywhere. It is really necessary to do things such as homework, bank transactions, business meetings and so on. At the same time, the Internet is one of the most important and efficient communication mediums such as e-mail and MSN. Today many people have a computer and they can use the Internet. Because it ensures benefit about time and cost. In addtion, many goverments have started to set up the new the Internet based projects such as e- goverment. 
If we look up the result of the last research about Internet use rates by age of head of household, we can easily see growth in the Internet user rate. According to the graph, there is at least 10 percent growth in the rate of Internet users who are under 35 in between 1998 and 2001, and there is a steady decrease between 2001 and 2002. And they are more active than other age groups about using the internet. Also, there is a similar growth in the middle - age Internet users. In 1998, the rate of the middle - age Internet users is higher than other age groups. In that term, some managers who work in the big and middle size companies have started to use the Internet especially in order to sent e-mail to the workers about meeting dates, personal profiles and working schedules. How about old people? Because of the Internet is a new invention, they couldn't adapt to the Internet as fast as teenagers. So there is less growth in the rate of the 65 and over age Internet users. But nowadays, old people are using the Internet, too. They don't need to go anywhere to buy a newspaper or to control their savings because they can also read the newspaper or control their savings on the Internet. To sum up, Internet will be inevitable for people in the future, and the growth in Internet usage rate will continue to increase.

I think I am a bit outgoing, a bit reserved. 
I love meeting new people because I enjoy being social. And the more people with whom I speak, the better I feel. For example, when I have been invited to discuss for a special conference with my professor to explain some very important logic of my theory toward many audiences, I felt amused because I liked to express my opinions. Also I value the time I have alone because I often prefer to read a book or a movie by myself than go to a party or meeting with my friends because it is difficult for me to communicate in unfamiliar situations. Therefore it is not easy to decide my status in this section.

Category 2: sensor or intuitive
I think I am near sensor because I like to concentrate on concrete information using what can be seen, heard, touched, tasted, or felt. At my graduate school in Korea, this habit was useful to gain the compiling of accurate data, which I was more inclined to experiment than to familiar approaches. Also the classmate, whose sister was the same habit as I had, wondered why I spent my precious time on a repeating preparation of gathering data. There was a time when the question served as a momentum to reconsider my habit. 

Category 3: thinker or feeler
In my case, making decisions or planning something about a job or activity is influenced by whether the way of something is reasonable or not. Therefore I really value concrete thinking and tend to be logical when I have to choose something, which can offer an important turning point for me. For instance, when I wanted to find the best company where I worked for a long time, I thought I had to review the company's financial situation, the wage, the number of employee, the chance of advancement, etc. to complete my best choice. On the other hand, I often have a very different process about a matter of preference such as a spark of interest that is highly empathic. Maybe I am more likely to make exceptions to rules for myself because I tend to rely on my experiences when I was right and I want to believe what I prefer. For example, five months ago, I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with my friend. The special Egypt exhibition hall where I visited was very wonderful. We saw fine works of art. After that we discussed about the plunder a colony of many treasures that couldn't be ended. At that time I insisted some reason that was supporting either side unfairly. I think that argument was the behavior as a feeler.

Category 4: judger or perceiver
If the process and the plan don't be set up, I feel uncomfortable, so I try to organize firmly by my principle, which I feel more comfortable sticking to conventional way. For example, I was unexpectedly asked to make a speech at my friend's wedding, so I began to stutter nervously. Also when my desk, workbench were messy because of my brother's play, I was angry because I thought my stuff was always neat and orderly. For this reason, I am near a judger.

15254,br7,2286,"Reforming and Opening-up Policy?A Watershed in Modern Chinese History

It is well-known that now the Chinese economy is improving rapidly and our Chinese people are very willing to share our culture with other countries. But if you see the pictures taken in China before 1979, you can find a very different China: people wore blue or black clothes and didn't dare to talk with strangers, especially the foreigners; products were sparse, and none enough cultural activities were held. Why has China had such a big change during these thirty years? In 1979, to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people and improve backward social production and status on the world stage, changes in economic, cultural and political policy were introduced by Deng Xiaoping, the third chief chairman of China. This new policy--we call it ""Reforming and Opening-up"", created two different eras in modern Chinese history.

After the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the planned economy was the lead policy of the Chinese economy. The government controlled all major sectors of the economy and formulated all decisions about using resources and the distribution of income and products. Americans must be very familiar with food stamps, which are offered to poor people for free by the US government. But in China, before 1979, there were not only the food stamps, but also the clothes stamps, oil stamps, watches stamps, bicycles stamps, televisions stamps, etc. These very limited stamps were distributed to each organization. The common people had to buy these stamps with money because only with these stamps they were able to buy products. Without enough supplies, people's standard of living was extremely low. Fortunately, Deng Xiaoping realized this adverse circumstance and advised the government to change the planned economy to the mixed economy, which includes elements of both the planned and market economies. Reform policies brought great improvements in the standard of living. At the same time, some special economic zones were founded to attract foreign investments. For example, Shenzhen, one of the earliest special economic zones, was only a small village in 1979, but now it is a big city with 12 million people. In this new economical system, because the decisions about what to produce, how to produce, and how to share products are mostly determined by the market instead of government interference, people had more freedom in buying and choosing products and more abundant products were produced. Those ""stamps"" are history now.

Before 1979, not only was the economic policy rigidified, but also people's cultural life was very bald. Common people rarely spent time and money on cultural activities. Actually, none enough activities were held. People kept the life mode as ""two points and one line (home workplace)"" every day. They did watch TV or listen to the radio, but the types of programs were also very limited. For example, the TV and radio programs only included news and some revolutionary songs hence people could not get enough information from these programs. Only few people have opportunities to study in foreign countries. As a result, Chinese people gave the world the impression that they did not care about the news from other countries and also did not intend to accept different cultures. These situations were also changed by the Reform policies in 1979. Literature and the arts blossomed, and Chinese intellectuals established extensive links with scholars in other countries. Many different kinds of cultures have been introduced in China. Since 1979, a lot of students and scholars have been invited to other countries for studying or visiting. In addition, as the standard of living, some new technology has entered common people's families. For instance, the internet, Karaoke, fitness equipment has been more popular. Chinese people can do several kinds of activities in their own homes. On the other hand, more public activities such as concerts, exhibitions are often held. Chinese people's cultural life is becoming more and more colorful. 

Chinese political environment was not very stable before 1979. Inside, the Chinese Communist Party controlled the government and gradually eliminated opposition. Outside, the government was dedicated to improving relationships with developing countries instead of the developed countries. For human rights, only very few efforts were done because of government's limitation of knowledge about democracy. Nevertheless, as the new policy has been implemented, the Chinese leadership has encouraged common people to adopt more critical approaches, although open attacks on party authority are not permitted now. About aspect of foreign policy, more friendly relationship has been founded between China and some developed countries such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, etc. China has also dedicated in   protecting human rights and has taken steps to bring its human rights policies into uniformity with international standards. 

Looking back the sixty years history of the People's Republic of China, we can see that it was divided into two important times by the reforming and opening-up policy. Every Chinese who lived in both the two times can profoundly experience these differences in economy, culture and politics. As a Chinese citizen, I love my mother country very much. I strongly believe that whatever changes exist, China is waking up. Just as Napoléon Bonaparte said, ""China is a sleeping giant. When it awakens, the earth will shake.""

Unfortunately, they find that it is very difficult and give up easily within a few days. However, it is possible to manage time effectively if they make a realistic schedule. Besides, they can also save time as they use short time which can be easily wasted and reduce unnecessary waste of time. These three ways are really useful to manage time.

Making a realistic schedule is the most important to manage time. Because people tend to make a schedule beyond their ability or without careful consideration, they are frustrated and do not want to follow it any more. They should make a schedule day by day and check how it goes daily. It helps to realize what to do specifically. In addition to it, they had better make a list on a notebook or a diary and check one by one. Also, writing a schedule in the order that it is important helps to finish the work efficiently. If the important works are done in advance, the rest of them can be done without feeling nervous.

Secondly, people who want to manage time should use short time which can be easily wasted. Because it is difficult to recognize that there is short time which is caused before starting another work, most people tend to miss it. However, it can be prevented if they are discernible about short time and try to do a couple of useful activities. For example, reading helpful books on a bus or train is one of the activities to prevent short time from being wasted. It is also effective way to use remaining time after having lunch. Because people waste this time or spend without any consideration, it would be a useful example which had not frequently used to manage time.

Reducing unnecessary waste of time is also necessary to save time. One of the ways to reduce unnecessary waste of time is to foster helpful habits. Finishing the work which people should do in any case is an example of a helpful habit. If they put off the work little by little, it must become a heavier burden. Inversely, people can manage their work properly as their plan if they finish each work at every moment. It is also a recommended habit to get up and go to bed at a regular time. Because irregular biorhythm makes people reluctant to work vigorously, it disturbs to manage time efficiently and makes people waste of time ultimately.

Time management is always regarded as one of the most important parts of the ordinary life. Most people recognize it and try to come up with the activities which can help to achieve it. Nevertheless, they have difficulty sticking with it and tend to give up early. Three ways which are mentioned above would be effective to manage time and following examples would help to achieve the three ways. Effective time management will be helpful not only to save time but also to make the individual's life vigorous.",Male,Korean,Please type in the first draft of your essay.

player of Berlin philharmonic orchestra. He is an incredible musician. Especially his CD of 

""BACH"" is amazingly good! Since I am majoring in performing the Flute, his performance 

always motivates me a lot. In addition, his performance makes me calm and feeling free. 

Because of these reasons, after listening to his music, I can study more and concentrate on 

anything more.  
     
In conclusion, although I think it is very difficult to clarify what are the specific causes 

of happiness for everyone since it is related to each person's emotion, eating tasty food and 

listening to good music are the causes of happiness for me.

As we all know the most major part of a bank's revenue is acquired from a loan business. Spending future money for enjoying present entertainment is a contemporary consumer culture  all over the world. Mortgage is built on the foundation of ancient pawnbroking.  The modern technology of mortgage classify the function of the pawnbroking . Before my graduating from a university ,I was not certain about my career path .However, after I worked in 3 banks within 4 years and a half, I have already known what field I want to work in . My professional plan of a career is become a mortgage manager. I 'm proud of my operational skills and the well known knowledge of an economic policy (such as exchange rate) and I am confident of my interpersonal skills and problem-solving. I wish I will have a high limited authority of handling a mortgage case in the future.  
The most important skill needed to succeed in becoming a mortgage manager is the ability of 
the interpersonal skills. It's so much fun to express myself wherever I go .One of the wonderful things about communicating with someone is to convey my  happiness and sincerity  . Make  new friends at a party and keep in touch with real estate companies so that I can get more information about my potential customers .Moreover, I like spending time on getting to know existing clients and I have to know as much as possible about client's need so that I could expand my business. I think cultivating a real dialogue might solidify the relationship with a client .

The second important skill is the background of my work experience and professional  knowledge. For an instance, I had passed the exam of anti-fake currency issued by China Central Bank . Eventually, I got the qualification certificate for anti-fake currency without doubt. Furthermore, every case could be handled by me within excellent high-speed . Meanwhile, I do not think an officer who works in an operational department and does an ordinary work looks like a robot. This is a basic work for every new colleague to start their careers. Fully master the whole operational work flow/line helps me understand economic policy .It could helps me to set an professional appearance in front of my clients as well.

The last but not least, the ability of problem - solving can be improved by social experience. You never know what you can do till you try . I never say no to my friends when we have different opinions but I try to talk them into understanding my opinion. And I never say no to my boss, because the decision can not be drawn by me. Therefore, I would say "" boss, I fully agreed with you plan ,we will achieve a great goal according to your perspective. If you can support us something ( eg : IT systerm ),we will do it better""  On the other hand , the skill of problem - solving  can helps me reduce trouble and increase sales opportunity . 

In summary , the most essential ability for a mortgage manager consists of   interpersonal skill , background of education and problem - solving . Fire is the test of gold. I just need an opportunity, and I 'm waiting for that day.

feel that you own the world. Also, it purifies your heart from hatred.
People have their own reasons to be happy, but they have common reasons.  
There are some factors that play a role to be happy such as having friends,
earning money and achieving goals.

Friendship is one of the main reasons to be happy. When you have people who
 have similar aspects to you such as interests and age, you will be happy. For
 example, when you are interested in sport , and you  find someone to
share this interest with, this will make you happy. In addition, when you have  a problem , and you  get support from them, you will be happy. For example,last year, I lost my wallet which has credit cards  when I was in Dubai -city  outside Saudi Arabia-, and one of my friends gave me money until I backed to Saudi Arabia, so I was happy.

money is one of the prime factors to be happy. When you have money, you
can get what you image  such as traveling and  having a big house  which lead to be happy . If you had a lot of money, you would travel to any 
place in the world even the moon , and you would see distinct cultures that
will make you not bored and happy. Moreover , if you had  a lot of
 money, you could buy a big house that has facilities such as swimming pool 
that will make you comfortable and happy.

Achieving goals is one of reasons to be happy. When you achieve 
your goals , you feel happy. For example, one of my goals was graduating from 
the university when I did that , I was happy for a month since it was difficult goal. The happiness varies based on the importance of goals. 

In summary, looking for happiness is the desire of people. There are many
 reasons such as money, goals and friends. Each one of them contribute in the 
happiness.

12610,dc6,1897,"Cooking Chicken Marsala

When I left Venezuela and came to the United State to take my English course, I never thought that I was going to fall in love with anybody. However, I met a wonderful man, and three months later, I became his girlfriend. Since then, I have just wanted to make him happy. On our first anniversary, I was excited with the idea of cooking my boyfriend's favorite dish. I had never cooked Chicken Marsala before, but I used to be a good cook, and I thought that I could deal with it. My first task was to get the recipe, and because my English was not good, I thought to make my life easier, and got the recipe 'in Spanish' on the internet. Little did I know that my worse nightmare was going to come true. 

The recipe said that one of the main ingredients was Marsala wine. When I went to the liquor store, I saw a huge aisle with a vast variety of Marsala wines. I dug through the shelves, but I didn't know what was the best wine for cooking my dish. In addition, all of them were very expensive and I could not afford it. So, I tried to get some information from the clerk, and she recommended that I go to the supermarket to get the wine. In the supermarket, I found only one type of Marsala wine, and it was perfect: cheap, and the label said 'for cooking'. Also, I thought that in the supermarket I could find the remainder of the ingredients. Suddenly, I was facing another trouble.

My Spanish recipe said that another ingredient was 'Maizena', but I had no idea what the name was in English. In addition, I had not brought my English-Spanish dictionary, I was not able to describe the thing that I wanted, and nobody could understand me. I spent two more hours in the supermarket, and I just gave up using 'Maizena' for thickening the sauce. At this point, I felt very frustrated because I could not communicate with anybody, and I suspected that I will not get succeed with my plan.  Therefore, as soon as I finished my shopping in the supermarket, I went to my house to start cooking the famous dish without 'Maizena'.

No doubt, I was annoyed because of all the obstacles that I had encountered.  However, I still wanted to impress my boyfriend. I recharged my batteries; I took my culinary weapon and started cooking. Then, I began to season the chicken, put it in the pan, and add the wine. While I was adding the Marsala, I noticed that the smell was not right, and the wine was not blending with the rest of the ingredients. Oh no!! I couldn't believe it. What else could happen to me? Well, I had not gotten the Maizena, and the sauce seemed watery. However, I finished cooking. Furthermore, I knew that the flavor was not the real flavor, but I thought that maybe, if did a good presentation, I still could impress my boyfriend.

Giving a good impression was my target, and to make a nice presentation of the food was part of it. I had two beautiful plates and fancy silverware as well.  Therefore, I was quickly creating a wonderful art because it was almost the hour for our date, and I had to hurry. I was running into the kitchen when I fell down on the floor, I dropped my boyfriend's plate, and the chicken was on the floor. Everything was a mess. My food was spread all over the floor, I did not have much time to cook another chicken breast, and there was nothing that I could do.

Finally, my boyfriend came over, and he felt all my frustration trying to do something important for him.  Then, my boyfriend told me wonderful words that made me feel better. After that experience, I learned two lessons that I could never forget. First, the name in English for Maizena is Corn Starch. Second, when you want to impress somebody, show your best side, but you do not have to try being a different person or do something that you do not know how do. The most important person in your life is you. If you enjoy the person that you are, everybody will like you.

When I was a little child, I was taught Mandarin in school. However, my parents always talked to me by Taiwanese. They knew Mandarin but not used it often. I didn't know how to say Taiwanese but I knew what they said. So I always answered by Mandarin. If I wanted to talk to my grandmother who just knew Taiwanese, I used Taiwanese words and my body language. 
     Now it's changed. Taiwanese are become more popular. Students are taught Mandarin and Taiwanese in school. People should know how to speak Taiwanese.    I even helped my parents working in a traditional market. There some people were from the Southern Taiwan. They just spoke Taiwanese. If someone talked to them by Mandarin no matter that people were customers or friends, they would be angry and no business with that people. They always told to me, "" You are not a real Taiwanese."" because my Taiwanese was not fluent like them. In this market, everyday I met a lot of different people and I had to change languages quickly.

And my grandfather encouraged my father to stick with his creativity unless he sustains it perfectly. My teacher has done the right thing when he was promoting me. He gave me the materials i need for free and use it whenever i need them. And what my father has done for me as promotion and motivation was exactly the same of my grandfather had done for him.

2- being structured means strict. But, organized activity and individual creativity makes children more eagerly creative and impress people. The school has the most responsibility to make its students creative or desperate by giving activities and showing student's inclinations. 
3- Without creativity learning will not be efficient. It is known that when teachers become more creative in the way they teach, it is much easier for the student to remember the actions than a set of notes. It provides the child more motivation to learn more , which needs unlimited time in doing that.
4- Flow is the ultimate state of creativity, where time does not matter. A person can experience this while doing something they enjoy doing and dedicate all their time and thoughts to it. The last time i experienced flow was when I had to design a software in a computer program when i was back home in Kuwait for my university. I love anything that has to do with computers, so this was one of the best moments I had trying to solve it and come up with the best out of it because i gave it all my time and effort. This should be organized in schools by providing the child with activities that they know they will love and want to participate in. Crafting ideas and being creative in the way the idea should cross to the child will be the best way to get their attention and make them interested.

Everyone knows that many of the Earth's resource can be not renewable and will eventually run out. At the same time some resources could be recycled. In order for our and our offspring's lives, it is time to conserve and recycle these resources as much as we can. A lot of materials can be recycled in our earth. How about you think this problem? I know it is a big problem in the word. Now let me introduce some suggestions that can get people to recycle it.

At first, I want to talk about metal recycle. Metal resource is invaluable, and numerous good products need metal. And its form is very complex. For example: aluminum metal recycling is a very important part of any family and community's recycling program.  Aluminum metal recycle is one of the easiest things you can do to help the environment. Many factories can recycle metal from used TV, cell phones, and computers. If these used products can be recycled and there are enough factories, the problem can be resolved well to some extent.

Second, our life can not continue without water. But the water resource can be used out, if we can not recycle it. Recycled water can satisfy most water demands, as long as it is adequately treated to ensure water quality appropriate for the use. How can we get water resources to be recycled? Ocean vaporizes water into the sky, then the water falls into the lake or river by rain, last it inflows into ocean again. It is the manner of  the water recycling in nature. We know that we need rely on freshwater. So we do not pollute the lake or river in the world. An alternative method is to recycled our used freshwater. If there is a day in the future, we can make sea water into freshwater. The problem can be solved thoroughly   

Third, we maybe couldn't imagine how many papers will be consumed in the world and everyday, nobody can imagine how many trees are be cut down everyday and how much dangerous factors will influence environment. But all of us know it is not so difficult to recycle papers, we only need do two things, one is separate used paper from other rubbish, and another is place it in recycle box. Question is whether everyone is so patient that he or she could separate all of used paper. 

There are many other materials that could be recycled in the world. Weather it can be done well, and everyone can begin to think about and take action. If we can get them to recycle, we could save many natural resources. For example: could you pick up each used envelope and each ad you read? If you can do it, could you place them recycle box every time? So do your best.",Male,Chinese,Remember to include concluding and introductory paragraphs!

8733,am1,1383,"Topic: How to make Maamool

Maamool is a traditional stuffed cookie in Saudi Arabia.  This dessert is usually served in festivals and weddings.  There are many kinds of Maamool depend on the variety of its stuffing.  Actually, all Maamool can follow the same recipe to get delicious Maamool at the end.  Therefore, Making Maamool is easy for everyone when they follow these steps and take the tips of preparing the Maamool dough, stuffing the Maamool and baking the Maamool.
First, Preparing the Maamool dough is a fundamental step to have delicious Maamool.  The dough contains four cups of flour, a cup of fat, a half cup of water and one teaspoon of Maamool's spice.  Before mixing these ingredients, heat the fat and add two cardamoms to it.  Soon afterwards, pour the hot fat on the mix of the flour with spice. Then, knead the flour with fat and put a few water to complete kneading; be careful, more water makes the dough tough. For the best results, you can use electricity dough mixer.  As soon as you get soft dough, cover the dough and put it in a warm place for eight hours.  Now, you are ready to make your Maamool. 
The next step is that to Choose one or more kinds of stuffing that you like in your Maamool.  In Saudi Arabia, many people prefer to have Maamool with dates.  However, you can also use nut dough or pistachio dough.  If you want to make typical Maamool, mix a pot of butter with date dough and then warm it on the stove.  Put one spoon of sesame and roll the date dough to small balls.  Eventually, spread thin layer of the dough on the Maamool cast and pot the date-ball stuffing in, then close it by removing the extra dough.  As you finish, you will have about twenty Maamool with dates as the same size of normal cookie for each. 
At this point, you need to bake the pieces of the Maamool.  Heat the oven to 400 Fahrenheit degrees.  Meanwhile, put these pieces on the baking sheet.  One important thing is that entering the Maamool in hot oven for two minutes, then low it to 300 degrees and wait for other seven minutes. This way will help keep your Maamool from being cracked.  Afterwards, remove the pieces of the Maamool out the oven and leave it until it cools down. In order to have a pretty look of the Maamool, spread powder sugar on each one.  
 As the previous steps, there are simple instructions to have soft, delicious Maamool.  A few tips of preparing the Maamool dough, stuffing the Maamool and baking the Maamool can make tasty Maamool.  I believe that you can make this traditional desert of Saudi Arabia in your country.  Moreover, you will be able to develop your own style of Maamool based on those steps of making Maamool.

38847,ed1,5215,"Industrial development only prevents our environment from destroying

     Many environmentalists think environmental destruction is caused by developing industries more and more. Some districts that have been destroyed are relevant to improving industries. Developing the resident area or golfing area has given a pain to our forests and shrubs. Those situations just have been for our purposes and profits, for instance. However, with the exception of a couple of examples, one thing that is imperative, but which we are often overlooking, is that the growth and development of industries can protect us from the damage of destroying nature, as well as rather giving the benefits to us.

     We can often find out that the regulation and the law of environment are different between the developed countries and the developing countries. Because the developed countries rather invest a lot of money in keeping the environment away from ruin than the developing countries, those countries that can control the law of environment. The developed countries can maintain clean environment because the constant development in those countries makes up the new science and new industry, each of which has the ability to deal with environment.

     Comparing with the past, industries tend to change gradually to new industries which create additional values such as the design of product, the reliability of product, etc. Specifically, industrial development in the past tended to pursue mass-produce because manufacturers, who did not think over the destruction of environment, just wanted to earn money a lot. However, after industrial development, developed industries got people to change their mind. People who noticed the problems of destroyed environment caused by development without thinking started producing immaterial factors that were capable of cutting down the possibility of environmental pollution. Consequently, industrial development in the world let us perceive the importance of environment, and it helps the environmental sustainability by making effective products.

     Industrial development in the world offers the opportunity to recover the destroyed environment. For example, purification facilities, which equipments we should spend much time researching are made by scientific evloution, help us make the water that has been polluted by factories, houses, and etc clean. Thus, the possibility of preserving environment would get bigger if industries in the world are developed constantly

     Only in the developed industries are able to preserve we our nature. Over millions of years, our environment has been improved by the purposes of people. Some people who became worried about destroyed environment object to develop environment. Nevertheless, developed environment can rather retain our circumstance by using new systems that are developed for conserving nature than their apprehension. Therefore, we need to develop the environment for our future.
