# Spell-Checker
This is Tingwei's term project. The goal of this project is to design a spell checker. The input will be a sentence with spelling mistakes. And the output will be a corrected sentence. Here is my [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Spell-Checker/blob/master/ELI_data_frame.ipynb).
